They are meant to assist the examiners and other Patent Division \nStaff to consistently apply the Act and the Regulations. However, they cannot be expected to \ncover all possible situations. The Guidelines are in essence the first step on the long journey \nof continuous improvement and towards establishment of standards for processing industrial \nproperty rights applications in the Institute. The Guidelines will be adapted where necessary \nto reflect the results of a learning process. More so decisions made by the Managing \nDirector, Industrial Property Tribunal and High Court as provided for in the Industrial \nProperty Act and the Regulations may serve to elaborate and enrich these guidelines.  \n \nFurther, it needs to be noted that the realms of industrial property covered in these \nguidelines is quite dynamic and therefore changes in the provisions of the Act and the \nregulations are expected. Such changes will need to be reflected in the guidelines in order to \nmaintain their relevance for day to day use in the Institute.  \n \nAny comments on these Guidelines and any subsequent changes will always be welcome. \nSuch comments should be directed to: \n \nThe Managing Director \nKenya Industrial Property Institute, \nP. O. Box 51648 – 00200, \nNairobi. \nTel: 254-2-602210/1 \nEmail: kipi@swiftkenya.com \n\n\nii \nAcknowledgement \nPreparation of Guidelines for the examination of Patents, Utility Models and Industrial \nDesigns was inspired and driven by the desire of the patent Division’s Staff to standardize \nand improve on the procedures for processing applications for patents, utility models and \nindustrial designs. Consequently the staff contributed greatly to the development of these \nguidelines. I wish to recognize the efforts of all who were involved in one way or another. \nOn behalf of the committee tasked to come up with the Guidelines, I am grateful for the \ncooperation and support that was received from other members of staff. I recognize the \nefforts of those who found time and made efforts to avail their comments and constructive \ncriticism formally and informally for they helped shape this document. \n \nSpecial acknowledgement goes to the team that dedicatedly worked on the final draft to \nensure that it was ready and specifically recognize the efforts of Mr.  Paul M. Chege (Senior \nTrademarks Examiner), Mr. Fredrick O. Omiti (Senior Patent Examiner), Mrs Eunice W. \nNjuguna (Chief Legal Officer), Mr. David N. Njuguna (Patent Examiner) and Mr. Reuben \nLangat (Senior Patent Examiner) for they went beyond the call of their duty to pursue the \nfinalization of this document. \n \nThe Managing Director, Prof. James Otieno Odek, in a special way contributed to the \nformulation of this document. He continually encouraged the committee to finalize the \ncompilation of the document. Most of all he provided the required resources for the \ncompletion of this work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMr. Joseph M. Mbeva  \nChief Patent Examiner \n(For and on behalf of the committee responsible  \nfor the preparation of the Guidelines)  \n\n\niii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \nAcknowledgement

guidelines give instructions as to the practice and procedure to be followed in the \nvarious aspects of processing industrial property applications and more specifically to grant \nand registration of patents, utility models and industrial designs in accordance with the \nIndustrial Property Act 2001(the Act) and the Industrial Property Regulations 2002 (the \nRegulations). However, adherence to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the rules made and the \nadministrative instructions issued thereunder are to be observed in dealing with international \npatent applications as far as the same are given effect under the Industrial Property Act \n2001 and any amendments thereafter. The same also applies to Harare Protocol with respect \nto regional applications. \n \nThe Guidelines are not intended to, and cannot, add to or subtract from the provisions of the \nAct or the Regulations. They are meant to assist the examiners to consistently apply the Act \nand the Regulations to the examination procedure, but they cannot be expected to cover all \npossible situations. The Institute and the users of the system understand that for all \nconcerned there will be a learning process. The Guidelines will be adapted where necessary \nto reflect the results of that learning process. \n \nReference in these guidelines to a section, followed by a number, is to be construed as \nreference to the Act and reference to a regulation will be construed as reference to the \nRegulations.  \n \n1.2 \nContacts of the Institute \nThe Institute is located in Nairobi South \"C\", Popo Road, off Mombasa Road, Weights and \nMeasures premises, P. O. Box 51648 - 00200, Nairobi, Telephone No. 602210/602211. Fax: \n606312. Email: kipi@swiftkenya.com or info@kipi.go.ke. Website: \n1.3 \nBusiness hours \nThe Registry is open to the public from 9.00 am to 1.00pm and 2.00 pm to 4.00 pm each \nday from Monday to Friday. If the last day for filing a document falls on a Saturday, a \nSunday or on a public holiday, the document may be filed on the next day following the \nSaturday, Sunday or the public holiday. \n1.4 \nInternational conventions and treaties  \nKenya is a member of a number of international treaties and conventions in the field of \nintellectual property. Such instruments have a direct bearing on the procedures and \nstandards adopted in dealing with industrial property matters. The treaties and conventions \ninclude:- \n1.4.1  \nParis convention  \nThe Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property contains provisions in regard to \nnational treatment and right of priority which are domesticated in the Act.  \n \n1.4.2 \nTrade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) \nAgreement \nThis is part of the multilateral trade agreements made under the general agreements in \ntariffs and trade (referred to as the GATT Agreement). It covers a wide range of intellectual \n\n\n \n2 \nproperty aspects and sets out the minimum standards of protection to be provided by each \nmember of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). \n1.4.3  \nPatent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) \nPatent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) is a system for filing international patent applications. It is \nadministered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Under the PCT, an \napplicant can file a patent application in all the member countries through a single \napplication.  \n1.4.4  \nHarare Protocol \n \nThe Harare Protocol is administered by the African Regional Intellectual Property \nOrganization (ARIPO). The protocol empowers ARIPO to grant patents and register industrial \ndesigns and utility models on behalf of the contracting states. 1.5 IP Forms \n \nThe prescribed forms for requesting any office actions are provided for in the First Schedule \nto the Regulations.  \n1.6 \nFees \nThe Act and the Regulations prescribe a schedule of fees payable to the Institute for various \nservices. The prescribed fees are set out in the Second Schedule to the Regulations. Fees \nmust be paid in Kenya Shillings by local applicants and US$ by foreign applicants. Payments \nmade in other currencies will not be accepted. The fees should be remitted to the Institute \neither by cash or cheque.  \n1.7 \nFiling of documents.   \nDocuments may be sent by post or filed in person. Where documents are sent by post the \ndate of receipt at the Institute shall be deemed to be the date that the Institute receives the \ndocument. Once documents are properly received and stamped, they become part of the file \nkept by the Institute and may not be returned unless they were submitted by error. \n1.8 \nIndustrial Property Journal \nThe Industrial Property Journal (the Journal), is a statutory monthly publication of the \nInstitute for the purpose of advertising industrial property applications and for publishing \nother matters required to be published under the Act;  \n \n1.9 \nRepresentation before the Institute (Sec. 34(2) )  \nNatural or legal persons not having either their domicile or their principal place of business or \na real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in Kenya must appoint an agent \nto act for them in all proceedings. If an application is made in these circumstances and an \nagent has not been appointed, the applicant will be requested in the examination report to \ndo so.  \n \nA representative shall be appointed through IP Form No. 39 for each application filed; and a \npayment of the requisite fees. \n\n\n \n3 \nPART II: PATENTS AND UTILITY MODELS \n \nChapter 1: \n Filing of documents and filing date examination \n1.1 \nPersons entitled to file an application  \nAn application for the grant and registration of a Kenyan patent, utility model, or industrial \ndesign may be filed by the inventor or any other person to whom she has transferred the \nright. It is presumed that a legal entity does not have the ability to invent or create but \nrather it is the natural persons working for the legal entity. It is on this basis that it is \nnecessary when a legal entity is filing the application, the application be accompanied by a \nstatement justifying the applicants right to a patent (S34 (3); R12 (8)). Such statement shall \nbe furnished on Form IP 4 or  assignment documents.  \n  \n1.2 \nReception of documents   \nAll documents relating to patents, utility models and designs are received at the front office \nof the patent registry and the date of receipt is stamped upon receipt of the documents. The \ndate of receipt should be applied as not to obliterate any part of the document or make \nthem unsuitable for direct reproduction.   \n \nUpon capturing the receipt of any application, the computer system generates the \napplication number automatically. The application is then forwarded to the accounts section \nfor reception of the applicable fees. From the accounts section the application is taken back \nto the front office for data capture. The application is then forwarded to the registry where  \na physical file is opened and the file is assigned to an examiner in the relevant field.   \n \nAll pages of any document received in respect of a new application should be marked with \nthe application number. In addition, copies of all correspondence issued by the Institute \nshould be included in the file, filed in chronological order in which the correspondence is sent \nto the applicant. \n1.3 \nFiling date  \nThe first task for the examiner is to determine whether the application meets the \nrequirements for according the filing date. These requirements are prescribed under section \n41 of the Act as the name of the applicant, description, claims and drawings where \nnecessary. \n \nThe documents referred to above should be in English but do not have to meet any \nparticular requirements as to form or presentation. It is essential however they be \nsufficiently legible to enable the information to be discerned. The applicant should be \nconsidered sufficiently identified whenever it is possible to establish the identity of the \napplicant beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of all data contained in the documents filed. \nWhere there is more than one applicant each applicant must be similarly identified. No \nobjection should be raised at this stage with regard to the status of the applicant or his \nentitlement to apply. The contents of the description and claims do not require close \nscrutiny.  It will be sufficient to identify a document which appears to include description and \none or more claims. \n \nIf the application does not fulfil these requirements the examiner is required to invite the \napplicant, within 14 days from the date of the examination, to submit the required \ncorrection. The invitation should indicate that the applicant has 60 days to comply. If the \n\n\n \n4 \napplicant does not comply with the invitation and, as a result, the examiner treats the \napplication as if it had not been filed, the examiner should, within fourteen days, inform the \napplicant in writing. \n \nWhere an application meets the aforementioned requirements, the receiving date becomes \nthe filing date and the same must be so communicated to the applicant in writing. \n\n\n \n5 \nChapter II: \nFormalities procedure for patent applications  \n(Sec. 41(7) Regulation 24 (4)) \n2.0 \nIntroduction \nBefore the application is accepted to proceed for search and substantive examination, the \nexaminer will carry out formality examination to determine whether the application complies \nwith the provisions of the Act and the Regulations as detailed below. The purpose of \nformality examination is to ascertain conformity of the application to the physical \nrequirements. These physical requirements are necessary to facilitate easy storage, search, \nretrieval and reproduction of the patent documents and comprehension of the subject matter \nof the application. (isn’t this part of substantive examination?) \n2.1 \nRequest (IP Form 3) sec. 34   \nThe examiner should check whether the request complies with the following:- \n• \nThe request for grant is based on a provisional or a final specification denoted by \nmarking the appropriate boxes on the form. If it is a provisional specification, the \nexaminer should inform the applicant that the final specification is due within one \nyear from the filing date and that the Institute will not process the application until \nthe final specification is filed. \n• \nIt states the name, address, nationality and country of residence of the applicant,  \n• \nIt states the name and address of the inventor  \n• \nIt states the name and address of the agent where necessary.  \n• \nIf there is more than one applicant, the request should set out, in addition to an \naddress for each applicant, a single address at which all the applicants can be \ncontacted. \n• \nFor each inventor, the request should be accompanied by an extra copy of the \nstatement if there is more than one inventor \n \n2.2 \nTitle of the invention \nWith regard to the title of the invention it should be checked to ascertain whether it is short \nand precise, as required under section 34(3) of the Act. \n \nForm IP 3 must also contain the title of the invention.  The title must clearly and concisely \nstate the technical designation of the invention and must exclude all fancy names. The \nexaminer should take the following into account: \n• \npersonal names, fancy names, the word \"patent\" or similar terms of a non-technical \nnature which do not  serve to identify the invention should not be used; \n• \nthe abbreviation \"etc.\", being vague, should not be used and should be replaced by \nan indication of what it is intended to cover; \n• \ntitles such as \"Method\", \"Apparatus\", \"Chemical Compounds\" alone o7 r similar vague \ntitles do not meet the requirement that the title must clearly state the technical \ndesignation of the invention; \n• \ntrade names and trade marks should also not be used; the examiner, however, need \nonly intervene when names are used which, according to common general \nknowledge, are trade names or trade marks. \n \n2.3 \nDescription \nWith regard to description of the invention, it should be ascertained that it  \na) states the title of the invention; \nb) specifies the technical field to which the invention relates; \n\n\n \n6 \nc) indicates the background art which, as far as it is known to the applicant, can be \nregarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the \ninvention; and \nd) indicates how the invention is industrially applicable. \n \n2.4 \nClaims \nWith respect to claims, they should be checked to find out whether they set out:- \na) the technical features that are necessary to define the subject matter of the invention \nbut that are part of the prior art (the preamble); and \nb) the technical features that, in combination with the features referred to in \nsubparagraph (a), define that for which protection is sought (the body). \nIt should be noted that the features set out in the claim under paragraph (b) above should \nbe preceded by an appropriate transition. Such transitions may be words such as \n“characterized in that”, “characterized by”, “wherein the improvement comprises” or any \nother words to the same effect.  \n \nIf the application contains more than ten claims, the applicant should be requested to pay \nexcess claims fee. \n \n2.5 \nForm and content of claims \na) \nTechnical features \nThe claims must be drafted in terms of the \"technical features of the invention\". This means \nthat claims should not contain any statements relating, for example, to commercial \nadvantages or other non-technical matters, but statements of purpose should be allowed if \nthey assist in defining the invention.  \n \nb) \nTwo-part format \nA claim should be drafted in two part format. The first   part (normally called the preamble) \nshould contain a statement indicating the designation of the subject-matter of the invention \ni.e. the general technical class of apparatus, process, etc. to which the invention relates, \nfollowed by a statement of those technical features which are necessary for the definition of \nthe claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art.  \n \nThis statement of prior-art features is applicable only to independent claims and not to \ndependent claims. It is clear that it is necessary only to refer to those prior art features \nwhich are relevant to the invention. For example, if the invention relates to a photographic \ncamera but the inventive step relates entirely to the shutter, it would be sufficient for the \nfirst part of the claim to read: \"A photographic camera including a focal plane shutter\" and \nthere is no need to refer also to the other known features of a camera such as the lens and \nview-finder.  \n \nThe second part or \"characterising portion\" should state the features which the invention \nadds to the prior art, i.e. the technical features for which, in combination with the features \nstated in sub-paragraph (a) (the first part), protection is sought. \n \nc) \nCategories \nThere are different \"categories\" of claim (\"products, process, apparatus or use\"). For many \ninventions, claims in more than one category are needed for full protection. In fact, there are \nonly two basic kinds of claim, viz. claims to a physical entity (product, apparatus) and claims \n\n\n \n7 \nto an activity (process, use). The first basic kind of claim (\"product claim\") includes a \nsubstance or compositions (e.g. chemical compound or a mixture of compounds) as well as \nany physical entity (e.g. object, article, apparatus, machine, or system of co-operating \napparatus) which is produced by a person's technical skill. Examples are: \"a steering \nmechanism incorporating an automatic feed-back circuit ...\"; \"a woven garment comprising \n...\"; \"an insecticide consisting of X, Y, Z\"; or \"a communication system comprising a plurality \nof transmitting and receiving stations\". The second basic kind of claim (\"process claim\") is \napplicable to all kinds of activities in which the use of some material product for effecting the \nprocess is implied; the activity may be exercised upon material products, upon energy, upon \nother processes (as in control processes) or upon living things. \n \nd) \nIndependent and dependent claims \nAll applications will contain one or more \"independent\" claims directed to the essential \nfeatures of the invention. Any such claim may be followed by one or more claims concerning \n\"particular embodiments\" of that invention.  \n \nAny claim which includes all the features of any other claim is termed a \"dependent claim\". \nSuch a claim must contain, if possible at the beginning, a reference to the other claim, all \nfeatures of which it includes. Since a dependent claim does not by itself define all the \ncharacterising features of the subject-matter which it claims, expressions such as \n\"characterised in that\" or \"characterised by\" are not necessary in such a claim but are \nnevertheless permissible. A claim defining further particulars of an invention may include all \nthe features of another dependent claim and should then refer back to that claim. Also, in \nsome cases, a dependent claim may define a particular feature or features which may \nappropriately be added to more than one previous claim (independent or dependent). It \nfollows that there are several possibilities: a dependent claim may refer back to one or more \nindependent claims, to one or more dependent claims, or to both independent and \ndependent claims. \ne) \nArrangement of claims \nAll dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim and those referring back to \nseveral previous claims must be grouped together to the extent and in the most appropriate \nway possible. The arrangement must therefore be one which enables the association of \nrelated claims to be readily determined and their meaning in association to be readily \nconstrued.  \n \n2.6 \nDrawings \nIf the specification contains drawings, the examiner should ascertain that they comply with \nthe following — \na) that they are not coloured; \nb) that the lines of the drawings are be black, durable, uniformly thick and well-defined.  \nc) that the drawings are such that all details can be distinguished without difficulty \nwhen the drawings are reproduced photographically at two thirds their actual size; \nd) that all numbers, letters and other references signs are at least .32 centimetres high \nand are circled or within brackets or inverted commas; \ne) that all features shown in the drawings are disclosed in the description and vice \nversa. \nf) that the different figures in the drawings are numbered consecutively in Arabic \nnumerals. \ng) that the drawings do not include text. \n \n\n\n \n8 \nWhere the application refers to drawings which are not included in the application, the \nexaminer should invite the applicant to furnish the missing drawings, and, if the applicant \ncomplies with the invitation, the filing date should re-dated to the date of receipt of the \nmissing drawings. If the applicant does not comply with the invitation any reference to the \ndrawings should be treated as non-existent. \n \n2.7 \nAbstract. \nThe examiner is to ascertain that the application contains an abstract. If the abstract is \npresent the examiner should check whether it starts on a new page and whether it \nincludes — \n(a)  \nthe title of the invention;  \n(b) \na summary of the disclosure included in the description.  \nThe summary should indicate the technical field to which the invention relates and the \nprincipal use or uses of the invention. The abstract should not include statements about the \nmerits or value of the invention or about uses that are speculative. It should not contain \nmore than one hundred and fifty words. It should try as much as possible to capture the \nmost relevant terms defining the invention. \n \n2.8 \nGeneral requirements  \nThe examiner should check to make sure that the application meets the following general \nrequirements; \n1) That the application is in triplicate. \n2) That each of the following is numbered as a separate series, using Arabic numerals with \nthe numbers centred at the top of the sheets but not in the top margin — \na) the request; \nb) the description, claims and abstract; and \nc) the drawings. \n3) That every fifth line of the description and the claims is numbered with the number \nappearing to the left of the line but not in the margin. \n4) That all parts of the application are prepared so that they are legible when they are \nphotocopied or otherwise reproduced. \n5) That the form of appointment of agent is filed (form IP 39) and the fee is paid. \n6) That there is statement justifying applicant’s right to patent if the applicant is not the \ninventor (form IP 4). \n \n2.9 \nAdditional formalities requirements for applications relating to living \nmatter. \nIf an application relates to a micro-biological process or the product thereof and involves the \nuse of a micro-organism which is not available to the public and which cannot be described \nin the patent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a \nperson skilled in the art, the examiner should ascertain that a deposit has been made to \neither KEMRI or KARI which are the recognized depository institutions for the purpose of \npatenting in Kenya by the date of filing the application. \n \nThe examiner should check whether the application provides the name of the depository \ninstitution and the file number of the culture deposit. Where the details of the deposited \nculture are not available at the time of filing, the applicant may submit the missing details \nwithin sixteen months from the date of filing or priority. \nIf the application has defects the examiner should invite the applicant to remedy the defects \nwithin 90 days from the date of the invitation. The applicant may apply for extension of this \n\n\n \n9 \ntime by filing form IP 7 and paying the requisite fee. Such extension should not exceed 60 \ndays. If the applicant does not comply with the invitation, the application should be rejected. \n2.10 Publication of the patent application (Sec. 42)  \nThe purpose of the publication is to inform the public of the pending patent application \nbefore the Institute. The patent application should be published after the expiration of \neighteen months from the filing date or, where priority is claimed, the date of priority. In \ncase of patent applications claiming priority, the term of eighteen months is construed from \nthe original filing date and in the case of patent applications with two or more priority claims, \nthe period is construed from the earliest priority dates.  \n \nBefore the application is published the applicant should be invited to pay the publication fee. \nThe Industrial Property Journal should be published monthly at the end of each calendar \nmonth. The technical preparation for the publication of the IP Journal is considered \nterminated on or before the 20th day of every month. Therefore, for any matter that has to \nappear in the Journal in a particular month, the payment should be received by the Institute \nbefore the termination of the technical preparation.   \n2.11  \nWithdrawal of application or priority claim \nIf after termination of the technical preparation the patent application is withdrawn to avoid \npublication, non-publication cannot be guaranteed. To avoid publication of the application \napplicants should at least withdraw their application before the 18th Month from the filing \ndate or where applicable the priority date. In the case of patent applications claiming \npriority, the term of eighteen months is construed from the earliest priority date. If the \napplicant abandons the priority claim, then the publication is deferred provided the \nnotification of the abandonment is received by the Institute before the termination of the \ntechnical preparation for publication. \n\n\n \n10 \n \nChapter III: \nSearch and Substantive Examination \n3.1 \nRequest for substantive examination \nAfter the application meets all formal requirements, the examiner should invite the applicant \nto request for substantive examination by filing form IP8 upon payment of the prescribed \nfee. Where no request is made within the prescribed period of three years, the application \nshall be deemed to be abandoned and the applicant should be informed in writing and the \nfact should be published in the Journal. \n3.2 \nProcedure after request  \nThe Purpose of examination is to ensure that the application and the invention to which it \nrelates meet the requirements set out in the relevant sections of the Act and the \nRegulations.  This chapter deals with search and examination following a request by the \napplicant for the application to be examined as to substance. \n3.3 \nSearch \nThe objective of the search is to discover the prior art relevant for the purpose of \ndetermining whether and if so to what extent, the invention to which the application relates \nis new and involves an inventive step pursuant to sections 22, 23 and 24 of the Act. \n \nThe examination procedure and the preparation of the search opinion depend on the search \nfor the knowledge of the state of the art on which assessment of the patentability of the \ninvention is based. The search must, therefore, be as complete and effective as possible, \nwithin the limitations necessarily imposed by issues such as unity of invention and other \nconsiderations. \n \nThe search is carried out in in-house or external collections of documents or databases, the \ncontents of which are systematically accessible, e.g. by means of words, classification \nsymbols or indexing codes. These are primarily patent documents of various countries, \nsupplemented by a number of articles from periodicals and other non-patent literature. \n \nA report should be prepared containing the results of the search, in particular by identifying \nthe documents constituting the relevant state of the art. \n \nThe search report serves to provide information on the relevant state of the art. it must be \nrealized that in a search, 100% completeness cannot always be obtained, because of such \nfactors as the inevitable imperfections of any information retrieval system and its \nimplementation, and may not be economically justified if the cost is to be kept within \nreasonable bounds.  \n \nFor applications claiming priority, the examiner should request the applicant, under section \n38 (2), to submit copies of any communication received by the applicant concerning the \nresults of any search or examination carried out in respect of the priority application. \n \nThe examiner should for reasons of economy exercise his judgement, based on his \nknowledge of the technology in question and of the available information retrieval systems, \nto omit sections of the documentation in which the likelihood of finding any documents \nrelevant to the search is negligible, for example documents falling within a period preceding \nthe time when the area of technology in question began to develop. \n\n\n \n11 \n3.4 \nSearch in analogous fields \nThe search is carried out in collections of documents or databases which may contain \nmaterial in all those technical fields pertinent to the invention. \n \nThe search strategy should determine the sections of the documentation to be consulted \ncovering all directly relevant technical fields, and may then have to be extended to sections \nof the documentation covering analogous fields, but the need for this must be judged by the \nexaminer in each individual case, taking into account the outcome of the search in the \nsections of the documentation initially consulted. \n \n \nThe decision to extend the search to fields not mentioned in the application must be left to \nthe judgement of the examiner, who should not put himself in the place of the inventor and \ntry to imagine all the kinds of applications of the invention possible. The overriding principle \nin determining the extension of the search in analogous fields should be whether it is \nprobable that a reasonable objection of lack of inventive step could be established on the \nbasis of what is likely to be found by the search in these fields  \n \n3.5 \nThe subject of the search \nBasis for the search \nThe search should be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description \nand drawings (if any). The claims determine the extent of the protection which will be \nconferred by the patent if granted. \n \n3.6 \nInterpretation of claims  \nThe search should on the one hand not be restricted to the literal wording of the claims, but \non the other hand should not be broadened to include everything that might be derived by a \nperson skilled in the art from a consideration of the description and drawings. The objective \nof the search is to discover prior art which is relevant to novelty and/or inventive step . The \nsearch should be directed to what appear to be the essential features of the invention and \ntake into account any changes in the (objective) technical problem underlying the invention \nwhich may occur during the search as a result of the retrieved prior art. In this regard it \nshould be noted that although explicit references in the claims to features elucidated in the \ndescription are only permissible where \"absolutely necessary\". Claims containing such \nreferences should still be searched if these technical features are unambiguously defined by \nspecific parts of the description. \n \nWhen interpreting claims for the purpose of the search, the search will also take into \nconsideration prior art incorporating technical features which are well known equivalents to \nthe technical features of the claimed invention, which may undermine inventive step. \n \n3.7 \nAmended claims \nWhere an application derives from an international application, the applicant may have \namended the international application in the international phase, either after receipt of the \ninternational search report (Art.19(1) PCT) or during international preliminary examination \n(Art. 34(2)(b) PCT). The applicant may then specify that he wishes to enter the phase with \nthese or otherwise amended application documents (including claims) according. \n \n\n\n \n12 \n3.8 \nAbandonment of claims  \nFor applications, claims that are deemed to have been abandoned for non-payment of fees \nmust be excluded from the search. This applies both to searches to be carried out in respect \nof directly-filed applications and to supplementary searches to be carried out in respect of \nPCT applications entering the national phase. \n  \n3.9 \nAnticipation of amendments to claims \nIn principle, and insofar as possible and reasonable, the search should cover the entire \nsubject-matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be \nexpected to be directed after they have been amended . \n \nFor example, where an application relating to an electric circuit contains one or more claims \nonly directed to the function and manner of operation, and the description and drawings \ninclude an example with a detailed non-trivial transistor circuit, the search should include this \ncircuit. \n \n3.10 Broad claims \nNo special search effort need be made for searching unduly wide or speculative claims, \nbeyond the extent to which they relate to matter which is sufficiently disclosed in the \napplication, and are supported by the description (Art. 84). If, for example, in an application \nrelating to and describing in detail an automatic telephone exchange, the claims are directed \nto an automatic communication switching centre, the search should not be extended to \nautomatic telegraph exchanges, data switching centres etc. merely because of the broad \nwording of the claim, but only if it is probable that such an extended search could produce a \ndocument on the basis of which a reasonable objection as regards lack of novelty or \ninventive step could be established.  \n \nLikewise, if a claim is directed to a process for manufacturing an \"impedance element\" but \nthe description and drawings relate only to the manufacture of a resistor element, and give \nno indication as to how other types of impedance element could be manufactured by the \nprocess of the invention, extension of the search to embrace, say, manufacture of capacitors \nwould not normally be justified.  \n \nIf the main claim relates to the chemical treatment of a substrate, whereas it appears from \nthe description or all the examples that the problem to be solved is solely dependent on the \nnature of natural leather, it is clear that the search should not be extended to the fields of \nplastics, fabrics or glass.  \n \nSimilarly, if the description and drawings are directed to a lock with a safety cylinder \nwhereas the claims refer to a device allowing the indexation of the angular position of a first \nelement with respect to two other rotating elements, then the search should be limited to \nlocks. In cases where the lack of disclosure or support is such as to render a meaningful \nsearch over the whole of the scope of the claim(s) impossible, a partial search or a \ndeclaration taking the place of a search report. \n \n3.11 Independent and dependent claims \nThe search carried out in sections of the documentation to be consulted for the independent \nclaim(s) must include all dependent claims. Dependent claims should be interpreted as being \nrestricted by all features of the claim(s) upon which they depend. Therefore, where the \nsubject-matter of an independent claim is novel that of its dependent claims will also be \n\n\n \n13 \nnovel. When the patentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim is not \nquestioned as a result of the search, there is no need to make a further search or cite \ndocuments in respect of the subject-matter of the dependent claims as such.  \n \nFor example, in an application relating to cathode ray oscilloscope tubes, in which the \nindependent claim is directed to specific means along the edge of the front of the tube for \nilluminating the screen and a dependent claim is directed to a specific connection between \nthe front and the main part of the tube, the examiner should, in the sections of the \ndocumentation he consults for searching the illumination means, also search for the \nconnecting means whether in combination with the illumination means or not.  \n \nIf, after this search, the patentability of the illuminating means is not questioned, the \nexaminer should not extend his search for the connecting means to further sections of the \ndocumentation which are likely to contain material pertinent to or specifically provided for \nthese connections.  \n \nIf in an application dealing with a pharmaceutical composition for treating nail infections the \npatentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim relating to specific combinations \nof the active ingredients is not questioned as a result of the search, there is no need to \ncontinue the search for dependent claims dealing with the use of a specific volatile organic \nsolvent as a carrier in the composition. \n \n \n3.12 Search on dependent claims \nHowever, where the patentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim is \nquestioned, it may be necessary for assessing whether the subject-matter of the dependent \nclaim as such is novel and involves an inventive step to continue the search in other sections \nof the documentation, e.g. in one or more additional classification units. No such special \nsearch should be made for features that are trivial or generally known in the art. However, if \na handbook or other document showing that a feature is generally known can be found \nrapidly, it should be cited. When the dependent claim adds a further feature (rather than \nproviding more detail of an element figuring already in the independent claim), the \ndependent claim is to be considered in combination with the features in the independent \nclaim and should be dealt with accordingly. \n \n3.13 Combination of elements in a claim \nFor claims characterised by a combination of elements (e.g. A, B and C) the search should \nbe directed towards the combination. However, when searching sections of the \ndocumentation for this purpose, sub-combinations, including the elements individually (e.g. \nA and B, A and C, B and C, and also A, B and C separately) should be searched in those \nsections at the same time. A search in additional sections of the documentation either for \nsub-combinations or for individual elements of the combination should only be performed if \nthis is still necessary for establishing the novelty of the element in order to assess the \ninventive step of the combination. \n \n3.14 Different categories \nWhen the application contains claims of different categories, all these must be included in \nthe search. However, if a product claim clearly seems to be both new and non-obvious, the \nexaminer should make no special effort to search claims for a process which inevitably \nresults in the manufacture of that product or for use of the product. When the application \ncontains only claims of one category, it may be desirable to include other categories in the \n\n\n \n14 \nsearch. For example, generally, i.e. except when the application contains indications to the \ncontrary, one may assume that in a claim directed to a chemical process, the starting \nproducts form part of the state of the art and need not be searched; the intermediate \nproducts are only searched when they form the subject of one or more claims; but the final \nproducts will always have to be searched, except when they are evidently known. \n \n3.15 Subject-matter excluded from search \nThe examiner may exclude certain subject-matter from his search. These exclusions may \nresult from certain subject-matter not complying with the provisions of the Act relating to \nexclusions from patentability or to susceptibility to industrial application. They may also arise \nwhere the application does not comply with the provisions of the Act to such an extent that a \nmeaningful search is impossible for some or all of the claims, or for a part of a claim, for \nother reasons. \n \n3.16 Lack of unity \nAlso, when the claims of the application do not relate to one invention only, nor to a group \nof inventions linked so as to form a single general inventive concept, the search will normally \nbe restricted to the invention or the linked group of inventions first mentioned in the claims.  \n \n3.17 Technological background \nIn certain circumstances it may be desirable to extend the subject-matter of the search to \ninclude the \"technological background\" of the invention. \nThis would include: \n– \nthe preamble to the first claim, i.e. the part preceding the expression \"characterised \nby\" or \"characterised in that\"; \n– \nthe state of the art which in the introduction of the description of the application is \nsaid to be known, but not identified by specific citations; \n– \nthe general technological background of the invention (often called \"general state of \nthe art\"). \n \n\n\n \n15 \nChapter IV: \nSearch Procedure and Strategy \n4.1 \n \nProcedure prior to searching \nAnalysis of the application when taking up an application to be searched, the examiner \nshould first consider the application in order to determine the subject of the claimed \ninvention. For this purpose he should make a critical analysis of the claims in the light of the \ndescription and drawings. He should in particular consider the content of the claims, \ndescription and drawings sufficiently to identify the problem underlying the invention, the \ninventive concept leading to its solution, the features essential to the solution as found in the \nclaims and the results and effects obtained.  \n \nFurthermore, where technical features which are not present in the claims are indicated in \nthe description as essential for the solution of the stated problem, these features should be \nincluded in the search. \n \n4.2 \n \nFormal deficiencies \nIf the examiner notices any formal shortcomings which have been overlooked during \nformality examination, he may invite the applicant to remedy these deficiencies. Such \ndeficiencies which the examiner might notice include: \n1) physical deficiencies of the application, including: \na) incorrect sequence and/or positioning of page numbering and/or failure to use Arabic \nnumerals in page numbering \nb) presence of drawings in the description and/or claims \nc) presence of erasures and/or alterations in the application documents, such that the \nauthenticity of the content and/other requirements for good reproduction are \njeopardized \n2) presence of prohibited matter in the application: \na) which is contrary to public order. \nb) constituting disparaging statements. \n3) failure to comply with the provisions relating to the deposition of biological material, in \nparticular with regard to the correct identification in the application of the depository \ninstitution and culture deposit number of the biological material assigned to the \ndeposited material by the depository institution.  \n \n4.3 \nDocuments cited in the application \nDocuments cited in the application under consideration should be examined if they are cited \nas the starting point of the invention, as showing the state of the art, or as giving alternative \nsolutions to the problem concerned, or when they are necessary for a correct understanding \nof the application.  \n \nHowever, when such citations clearly relate only to details not directly relevant to the \nclaimed invention, they may be disregarded. In the exceptional case that the application \ncites a document that is not published or otherwise not accessible to the examiner and the \ndocument appears essential to a correct understanding of the invention to the extent that a \nmeaningful search would not be possible without knowledge of the content of that \ndocument, the Examiner should postpone the search and request the applicant to provide a \ncopy of the document.  \n \nIf no copy of the document is received, an attempt is made to carry out the search and then, \nif necessary, a partial search report or, where applicable, a declaration replacing the search \nreport is prepared.  \n\n\n \n16 \n \nThis partial search report or declaration will be issued giving the following grounds: \n(i) \nthe non-availability of the document rendered the invention insufficiently disclosed \nwithin the meaning of section 34(5); and \n(ii) \nthe insufficient disclosure mentioned in (i) existed to such a degree that a meaningful \nsearch was not possible on at least part of the claimed invention. \nIt should also be noted that where the applicant furnishes the document after the search \nreport and the search opinion (if applicable, have been prepared, an additional search on \nthat subject-matter originally excluded from the search may be carried out due to the \ncorrection of the deficiency which led to the partial search.  \n \n4.4 \nAbstract; official classification; title of the invention; publication \nThe examiner should then consider the abstract (together with the title of the invention and \nthe figure, if any, of the drawings to be published with the abstract) in relation to the \nrequirements laid down in the Regulations. Since the abstract should relate to the application \nas filed, the examiner should consider it and determine its definitive content before carrying \nout the search, in order to avoid being inadvertently influenced by the results of the search. \nIf publication of the application is due before the search report is drawn up, the examiner \nhas to establish the official classification of the application much earlier before he carries out \nthe search; he examines then at the same time the abstract for the purpose of publication.  \n \nThis examination of the abstract does not go beyond ensuring that it relates to the \napplication concerned and that no conflict exists with the title of the invention or with the \nclassification of the application. Information in relation to the abstract, the title of the \ninvention and the figure, if any, of the drawings to be published with the abstract should  \ntransmitted to the applicant in the communication accompanying the search report.  \n \n4.5 \n \nSearch strategy \n4.5.1  \nSubject of the search; restrictions \nHaving determined the subject of the invention as outlined above it may be desirable for the \nexaminer to prepare first a search statement, defining the subject of his search as precisely \nas possible. In many instances one or more of the claims may themselves serve this \npurpose, but they may have to be generalised in order to cover all aspects and embodiments \nof the invention.  \n \nAt this time, the considerations relating to subjects excluded from patentability and to lack of \nunity of invention should be borne in mind. The examiner may also have to restrict the \nsearch because the requirements of the Act are not met to such an extent that a meaningful \nsearch is impossible. Any such restrictions to the search must be indicated in the partial \nsearch or declaration taking the place of the search report. \n \n4.5.2  \nFormulating a search strategy \nNext the examiner should start the search process by formulating a search strategy, i.e. a \nplan consisting of a series of search statements expressing the subject of the search, \nresulting in sections of the documentation to be consulted for the search. In its initial phase, \na search strategy will contain one or more combinations of the basic components mentioned \nabove. The search process should be interactive and iterative in the sense that the examiner \nshould reformulate his initial search statement(s) according to the usefulness of the \ninformation retrieved. When using classification units, the examiner should select the \n\n\n \n17 \nclassification units to be consulted for the search, both in all directly relevant fields and in \nanalogous fields. The selection of the classification units in related fields should be limited to: \n(i) \nhigher subdivisions allowing searching by abstraction (generalisation) inasmuch \nas this is justified from a technical viewpoint; and \n(ii) \nparallel subdivisions, bearing in mind the fact that the fields in question will \nbecome increasingly unrelated. \nWhen the examiner is in doubt about the appropriate fields in which to conduct his search, \nhe may request advice from the appropriate supervisor. \n \nUsually various search strategies are possible, and the examiner should exercise his \njudgement, based on his experience and knowledge of the available search tools, to select \nthe search strategy most appropriate to the case in hand. He should give precedence to \nsearch strategies yielding sections of the documentation in which the probability of finding \nrelevant documents is highest. Usually the main technical field of the application will be \ngiven precedence, starting with the basic components most relevant to the specific \nexample(s) and preferred embodiments of the claimed invention. \n \n4.5.3  \nCarrying out the search; types of documents \nThe examiner should then carry out the search, directing his attention to documents relevant \nfor novelty and inventive step. He should also note any documents that may be of \nimportance for other reasons, such as: \n \n(i) conflicting applications which are: \n(a) published  applications   \n(b) published international applications  \nWhen published within the priority interval of the application under search, these \napplications are cited in the search report as \"P\" documents; when published after the \nnational or international filing date, they are cited in the search report as \"E\" documents ; \n \n(ii) documents putting doubt upon the validity of any priority claimed, which are cited in the \nsearch report as \"L\" documents  \n \n(iii) documents contributing to a better or more correct understanding of the claimed \ninvention, which are cited in the search report as \"T\" documents; \n \n(iv) documents illustrating the technological background, which are cited in the search report \nas \"A\" documents, where these documents do not constitute the closest state of the art ; \nand \n \n(v)  patent applications having the same filing or priority date as the application in respect of \nwhich the search is carried out, from the same applicant and relating to the same invention \nand therefore relevant to the issue of double patenting, which are cited in the search report \nas \"L\" documents, but he should not spend a significant amount of time in searching for \nthese documents, nor in the consideration of such matters unless there is a special reason \nfor doing so in a particular case.. \n \nThe examiner should concentrate his search efforts on the use of search strategies yielding \nsections of the documentation in which the probability of finding highly relevant documents \nis greatest, and, in considering whether to extend the search to other less relevant sections \nof the documentation, he should always take account of the search results already obtained. \n \n\n\n \n18 \n4.5.4  \nReformulation of the subject of the search \nThe examiner should continuously evaluate the results of his search, and if necessary \nreformulate the subject of the search accordingly. For example, the selection of the \nclassification units to be searched or the order of searching them may also require alteration \nduring the search as a consequence of intermediate results obtained. The examiner should \nalso use his judgement, taking into account results obtained, in deciding at any time during \nthe systematic search whether he should approach the search documentation in some \ndifferent manner, e.g. by consulting: \n(i) \ndocuments cited in relevant documents produced by the search, for example cited \nin the description or search report of a patent document; or \n(ii) \ndocuments citing a relevant document produced by the search, or whether he \nshould turn to documentation outside that which is available to the Examiner. \nWhen searching external document collections for material in relation to unpublished \nsubject-matter using other than secure connections, like the Internet, the examiner should \nbe extremely careful when formulating search strategies so as not to unwittingly reveal \nconfidential material – i.e. any part of the unpublished patent application. \n \n4.5.5  \nClosest prior art and its effects on the search \nIt may happen that the examiner does not find any documents published before the earliest \npriority date which prejudices the novelty or the inventive step of the claimed invention. In \nsuch cases, the examiner should, whenever possible, cite in the search report at least that \nprior art found in the course of search which discloses a solution to the same problem as \nthat underlying the claimed invention (wherein this problem may change depending on the \nprior art retrieved and wherein the known solution is technically the closest to the claimed \nsolution (\"closest prior art\"). Such prior art is to be cited as an \"A\" document in the search \nreport. \n \nIf such a document cannot be found, the examiner should cite as the closest prior art a \ndocument which solves a problem closely related to the problem underlying the claimed \ninvention and wherein the solution is technically most similar to that of the application under \nsearch. \n \nWhere the examiner retrieves documents which are incidentally prejudicial to the novelty of \nthe claimed invention but which do not affect the inventive step thereof after appropriate \namendment of the application, and does not retrieve any other documents prejudicing \ninventive step, the examiner should also proceed as above. \n \nIn the case of an  national application derived from an international application and being \nsubjected to a supplementary search after entering the national phase , it is possible that the \nexaminer does not uncover any further relevant prior-art documents in the search over and \nabove the documents already cited in the international search report by the International \nSearching Authority. In such cases, it is permissible to have no further relevant documents in \nthe supplementary search report. \n \n4.5.6  \nEnd of search \nReasons of economy dictate that the examiner use his judgement to end his search when \nthe probability of discovering further relevant prior art becomes very low in relation to the \neffort needed. The search may also be stopped when documents have been found clearly \ndemonstrating lack of novelty in the entire subject-matter of the claimed invention and its \nelaborations in the description, apart from features which are trivial or common general \nknowledge in the field under examination, application of which features would not involve \n\n\n \n19 \ninventive step. The search for conflicting applications should, however, always be completed \nto the extent that these are present in the available documentation. \n \n4.5.7  \nPreparation of the search report \nAfter completion of the search, the examiner should select from the documents retrieved the \nones to be cited in the report. These should always include the most relevant documents \n(which will be specially characterised in the report. Less relevant documents should only be \ncited when they concern aspects or details of the claimed invention not found in the \ndocuments already selected for citation. To avoid increasing costs unnecessarily, the \nexaminer should not cite more documents than is necessary and therefore, when there are \nseveral documents of equal relevance, the search report should not normally cite more than \none of them.  Subsequently, the examiner prepares the search report. \n \n4.5.8  \nDocuments discovered after completion of the search \nIt may happen occasionally, that after completion of a search report, the Examiner discovers \nfurther relevant documents (e.g. in a later search for a related application). These \ndocuments should be added to the search report up to the time that preparations for its \npublication are completed. Up to the filing of a request for examination, such later \ndiscovered documents should be communicated to the applicant. Thereafter, such \ndocuments may be used in examination. \n \n4.5.9  \nErrors in the search report \nWhen a material error is found to be present in a search report prior to publication thereof, a \nnew search report will be drawn up which supersedes the preceding one. Where the search \nreport has already been sent to the applicant, the error should immediately be notified to the \napplicant. When a serious error is noted following publication of the application, a \ncorrigendum is published in the Journal. If the error comprises the transmission of an \nincorrect document as a citation, the correct document should be sent. \n \n4.6 \n \nClassification of Patent Applications \nThe official classification of the patent application is performed by the examiner, using the \nclassification symbols contained in the rules of the IPC for the inventions as claimed \n(\"Obligatory Classification\"). He can also assign appropriate classification symbols and/or \nindexing codes to any additional information (\"Non-Obligatory Classification\") as defined in \nthe Guide to the IPC in force at the time. \n \n4.6.1  \nPre-classification (routing) \nThe level of classification at this stage should be as general as practicable on the basis of a \nquick and cursory scrutiny of the document (e.g. the title and independent claim or claims). \nOn the other hand, the level should be specific enough to avoid the need for any \nintermediate stage of preclassification before allocation to the competent section. \n \nThe preclassification required for this first allocation should be made on the basis of the \nindependent claims. If this results in preclassification in more than one sub-class, then \nwhichever of these seems to be the most relevant to the claimed invention (or the invention \nfirst claimed, if there is lack of unity of invention) should be selected.  In most cases no \nfurther classification is required to enable applications to be allotted to the Examiner but, \n\n\n \n20 \nwhere it is necessary, it falls within the authority of the examiner in charge of the field to \narrange for such allotment in an expedient manner. \n \n4.6.2  \nIncorrect preclassification \nIf, on reaching the section, an application has been found to be incorrectly preclassified and \nthus inappropriately allocated, it is reclassified and re-allocated by the section receiving it, \nthe indication on the dossier being appropriately amended.  \n \n4.6.3  \nClassification of the application \nThe classification of the patent application is performed by the examiner as described above. \nPreferably, this should be done when he has studied the content of the application in order \nto carry out the search. However, if publication of the application is due before the search \nreport is drawn up, it is necessary for the examiner to study the application sufficiently to \ndetermine the official classification at this earlier stage. \n \nIf the classification of the application is in more than one sub-class, or more than one main \n(\"00\") group within a sub-class, then all such classifications should be assigned. The \nclassification of the invention as claimed should be distinguished from any additional \nclassification and/or indexing code.  \n \nIn addition, where it is necessary to assign more than one symbol for the invention itself, the \nsymbol which in the examiner's opinion most adequately identifies it, or, when this presents \ndifficulties, the symbol which identifies the invention for which most information is given, \nshould be indicated first, e.g. in order to facilitate subsequent allocation of the applications. \n \nThe classification should be determined without taking into consideration the probable \ncontent of the application after any amendment, since this classification should relate to the \ndisclosure in the published application, i.e. the application as filed. If, however, the \nexaminer's understanding of the invention, or of the content of the application as filed, alters \nsignificantly as a result of the search (e.g. as a result of prior art found or because of \nclarification of apparent obscurities), he should amend the classification accordingly, if the \npreparations for publication have not at that stage been completed. \n \n4.6.4 Classification when the scope of the invention is not clear (e.g. a partial \nsearch) \nWhen the scope of the invention is not clear, the classification has to be based on what \nappears to be the invention insofar as this can be understood. It is then necessary to amend \nit if obscurities are removed by the search. \n \nClassification in cases of a lack of unity of invention \nWhere objection of lack of unity of invention arises, all inventions must be classified, since all \nwill be disclosed in the published application.  \n \nVerification of official classification \nAs a general rule, applications will not be systematically scrutinised after leaving the \nExaminer in order to verify the correctness of the official classification assigned by the \nexaminer.  \n \n\n\n \n21 \n \nChapter V: \nThe State of the Art \n5.1 \nState of the art – oral disclosure, etc. \n \nAccording to section 23(2), oral disclosure, use, exhibition, etc. are recognized as prior art. \nHowever, the examiner, in carrying out a search, should cite an oral description, etc. as prior \nart only if he has available a written confirmation or is otherwise convinced that the facts can \nbe proved. Such references to oral disclosure, prior public use, disclosure by sale, etc. are \nmore usually brought up by opponents in invalidation/ revocation proceedings. \n \n5.2 \nPriority \nIf the claimed priority dates cannot be verified at this stage, uncertainty will exist as regards \ntheir validity and the search for conflicting applications should be extended so as to cover all \npublished applications with an earliest claimed priority date up to the filing date (not the \nclaimed priority date(s)) of the application under consideration. \n \n5.3 \nConflicting applications \nPotentially conflicting national and international applications \nGenerally, where the search is concluded less than eighteen months after the  national or \ninternational filing date of the application (the filing date according to Art. 80 and not its \nclaimed priority date(s)), it will not be possible at the time of the search to make a complete \nsearch for potentially conflicting  national and international applications.  \n \n5.4 \nDate of reference for documents cited in the search report; filing and \npriority date \n \n5.4.1  \nVerification of claimed priority date(s) \nWhere the validity of the priority claim cannot be verified at the search stage, the basic \nreference date for the search must be taken as the date of filing of the application as \naccorded. \n \n5.4.2  \nIntermediate documents \nThe Examiner takes into account documents published between the earliest priority date and \nthe filing date of the application under consideration, and these documents are identified as \nsuch in the search report. For identifying these documents when an application has more \nthan one priority date, the oldest date is to be applied.  \n \nWhen deciding which documents to select for citing in the search report, the examiner refers \nto these dates and should preferably choose any published before the date of priority. Thus, \nfor example, where there are two documents, one published before the date of priority and \nthe other after that date but before the date of filing, but otherwise equally relevant, he \nshould choose the former. \n \n \n\n\n \n22 \n5.5 \nDoubts as to the validity of the priority claim; extension of the Search  \n \nIt is the responsibility of the Examiner to check whether and to what extent the priority claim \nis justified. However, where intervening state of the art or potential state of the art is \nrevealed in the search, the Examiner should, if possible, check the validity of the priority \nclaim. Furthermore, documents showing that a priority claim might not be justified (e.g. an \nearlier application or patent from the same applicant indicating that the application from \nwhich priority is claimed may not be the first application for the invention concerned) should \nbe cited in the search report. However, no special search effort should normally be made for \nthis purpose, except when there is a special reason to do so, e.g. when the priority \napplication is a \"continuation-in-part\" of an earlier application from which no priority is \nclaimed. \n \nSometimes the fact that the country of residence of the applicant is different from the \ncountry of the priority application may also be an indication that it is not a first filing, \njustifying a certain extension of the search. \n \nWhen the search is extended for this purpose, it should be directed to: \n(i) published patent documents filed earlier than the claimed priority date. \n(ii) published patent documents which claim priority from an application filed earlier than the \npriority date of the application being searched. \n \n5.6 \nDocuments published after the filing date \nThe search does not normally take into consideration documents published after the filing \ndate of the application. However, some extension is necessary for specific purposes, and \ncertain other situations may occur in which a document published after the filing date is \nrelevant; examples are a later document containing the principle or theory underlying the \ninvention, which may be useful for a better understanding of the invention, or a later \ndocument showing that the reasoning or the facts underlying the invention are incorrect. The \nsearch should not be extended for this purpose, but documents of this nature known to the \nexaminer could be selected for citation in the report. \n \n5.7 \nNon-prejudicial disclosures \nDisclosures of the invention should not be taken into consideration if they occurred no earlier \nthan six months preceding the filing of the patent application and if they were due to an \nevident abuse in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor, or due to display at an \nofficial, or officially recognised, international exhibition. The Examiner should, nevertheless, \ncite in the search report any documents he has reason to believe is relevant. In this case too \nthe reference date for the search will be the filing date of the application.  \n \n5.8 \nContents of Prior-art Disclosures \n5.8.1  \nGeneral remark \nAs a general rule, the Examiner selects for citation only documents which are present in the \nsearch documentation or which it has access to in some other manner. In that way, no \ndoubt exists about the contents of the documents cited, since the examiner generally has \nphysically inspected each document cited. \n \n\n\n \n23 \n5.8.2 Citation of documents corresponding to documents not available English.  \n \nUnder certain circumstances a document whose contents have not been verified may be \ncited, provided there is justification for the assumption that there is identity of content with \nanother document which the examiner has inspected; both documents should then be \nmentioned in the search report. For example, instead of the document published before the \nfiling date in a language other than English and selected for citation, the examiner may have \ninspected a corresponding document (e.g. another member of the same patent family, or a \ntranslation of an article) in English and possibly published after the filing date. Also it may be \nassumed that, in the absence of explicit indications to the contrary, the contents of an \nabstract are contained in the original document. Further, it should be assumed that the \ncontents of a report of an oral presentation are in agreement with that presentation. \n \n5.9 \nUnity of Invention \n5.9.1  \nGeneral remarks \nIf the Examiner considers that the application does not comply with the requirement of unity \nof invention, he must search it, and draw up the partial search report, for those parts of the \napplication which relate to the invention (or group of inventions forming unity) first \nmentioned in the claims. The partial search report is supplemented with a specification of the \nseparate inventions. \n \nWith regard to the search opinion in cases of a lack of unity of invention, when determining \nwhich invention is the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims, \nthe examiner takes account of the content of the dependent claims, disregarding trivial \nclaims. \n \n5.9.2  \nDecision with respect to unity of invention \nThe examiner should not raise an objection of lack of unity merely because the inventions \nclaimed are classified in separate classification units, or merely for the purpose of restricting \nthe search to certain sections of the documentation, for example, certain classification units. \n \n5.10  \nSubject – matter to be Excluded from the Search \n5.11  \nGeneral remarks \nIn relation to searches, the subject-matter listed in section 21(3) may be considered under \nthe Act as either not to be industrially applicable or, to the extent that the patent application \nrelates to that subject matter as such, to be excluded from patentability, or to constitute an \nexception to patentability under section 26, the claims are not searched in as far as they \nrelate to such subject matter.  \n \nThe Examiner has thus to consider the requirements for patentability other than novelty and \ninventive step. The above-mentioned situations may also occur for only some of the claims \nor for part of a claim. In these cases, this will be indicated in the search or the declaration \ntaking the place of the search report. \n \nMethods for treatment of the human or animal body; diagnostic methods \nWith regard to methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, or \ndiagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body, it should be noted that \nproducts, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods, are not \nexcluded from patentability, provided that the use of the product for any such method is not \n\n\n \n24 \ncomprised in the state of the art. It should be noted that a claim in the form \"Use of a \nsubstance or composition X for the manufacture of a medicament for therapeutic application \nZ\" may be allowable for either a first or \"subsequent\" such application. \n \nEven if a claim is drafted as a method of medical treatment and is for this reason not \ndirected to patentable subject-matter, a meaningful search may be possible if the \ndetermining technical feature is the effect of the substance, which can be searched. If, \nhowever, specific method features are present (e.g. dosing instructions for the user, \ncombination of pharmaceutical with physical treatment), a meaningful search may not be \npossible. In cases of doubt the Examiner should carry out the search to the extent that this \nis possible in the available documentation. \nHowever, regardless of whether such claims are searched or not, the applicant’s attention \nshould be drawn on the search opinion (if applicable, to the exclusion of such subject matter \nfrom industrial application. \n \n5.12  \nNo meaningful search possible \nA limitation of the search may also result from the application not meeting the relevant \nrequirements of the Act to such an extent that a meaningful search of the claims, or of some \nof the claims, or of part of a claim, is impossible. In such cases, the Examiner should make a \nmeaningful search to the extent that this is possible. What is or is not \"meaningful\" is a \nquestion of fact for the Examiner to determine. The exercise of the discretion of the \nExaminer will depend upon the facts of the case. There are clearly cases where a search is \nrendered de facto impossible by the failure to meet the prescribed requirements of the Act. \nBut these are not the only circumstances under which Rule 45 may be invoked. The word \n\"meaningful\" should be construed reasonably. \n \nOn the one hand, the word \"meaningful\" should not be construed in such a way that it is \ninvoked simply because a search is difficult. On the other hand, it may be the case that a \ngiven claim could, theoretically, be searched completely, but that nevertheless, the Examiner \ncomes to the conclusion, under a proper consideration of the relevant provisions of the Act, \nthat it would not be meaningful to do so, in the sense that it would not serve any useful \npurpose to do so having regard, for example, to any possible future prosecution of the \napplication. \n \nIn other cases, it may be that the results of the search themselves would be quite \nmeaningless. A number of non-limiting examples illustrated below: \n(i) Claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure \nOne example would be the case of a broad or speculative claim supported by only a limited \ndisclosure covering a small part of the scope of the claim. If the broadness of the claim is \nsuch as to render a meaningful search over the whole of the claim impossible, the Examiner \nwill carry out the search on the basis of the narrower, disclosed invention. This may mean a \nsearch of the specific examples. In such a case, it will often be de facto impossible to do a \ncomplete search of the whole of the claim at all, because of the broad drafting style. In other \ncases, a search of the whole of the claim would serve no useful purpose, as the claim would \nnot be defensible in any subsequent examination phase. Accordingly, the search will be \nlimited. Here, the requirements underlying the limitation would be those of sufficiency of \ndisclosure and support set out in section 34(5) and section 53(2). \n \n(ii) Claims lacking conciseness \nAn example would be where there are so many claims, or so many possibilities within a \nclaim, that it becomes unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection is \n\n\n \n25 \nsought. A complete search (or any search at all) may de facto be impossible, or alternatively \nmay serve no useful purpose as the claim or claim set would be indefensible in any \nsubsequent examination phase. Again, a partial search or a declaration of no search at all \nmay be appropriate, on the grounds that the lack of conciseness of the claim(s) is such as to \nrender a meaningful search impossible. \n \n(iii) Claims lacking clarity \nAn example would be where the applicant's choice of parameter to define his invention \nrenders a meaningful comparison with the prior art impossible, perhaps because the prior art \nhas not employed the same parameter, or has employed no parameter at all. In such a case, \nthe parameter chosen by the applicant may lack clarity. It may be that the lack of clarity of \nthe parameter is such as to render a meaningful search of the claims or of a claim or of a \npart of a claim impossible, because the results of any search would be meaningless, the \nchoice of parameter rendering a sensible comparison of the claimed invention with the prior \nart impossible. If so, a partial search will be appropriate, the search possibly being restricted \nto the worked examples, as far as they can be understood, or to the way in which the \ndesired parameter is obtained. \n \nThese examples are not exhaustive. The basic principle is that there should be clarity and \nopenness both for the applicant and for third parties as to what has and what has not been \nsearched. Exceptionally, the Examiner may, at his own discretion, where he thinks it \nappropriate, ask the applicant informally for clarification before deciding whether or not to \nlimit the search in respect of some or all of the claims, or for part of a claim or issue a \ndeclaration replacing the search report. \n \nIf the deficiencies which rendered a meaningful search impossible are subsequently \ncorrected by amendment or if their existence is successfully refuted by the applicant during \nthe substantive phase of examination, then an additional search may be carried out in the \nexamination procedure. \n \n5.13  \nSearch report \nGeneral \nThe results of the search will be recorded in a search report. A number of different possible \nlimitations of the scope of the search report exist. These are: \n(i) where claims are deemed abandoned for non-payment of claims fees; \n(ii) a declaration replacing the search report \n(iii) a partial search report according; \n(iv) a partial  search report due to a finding of a lack of unity of invention. \n \nA search report must contain no matter, in particular no expressions of opinion, reasoning, \narguments or explanations, other than that required as in the search form. \n \nForm \nThe search report should be prepared by the examiner and should contains a main page to \nbe used for all searches for recording the important features of the search, such as: \n(i) the application number; \n(ii) the classification of the application; \n(iii) the fields searched; \n(iv) the relevant documents revealed by the search; and \n(v) the name of the examiner who executed the search, as well as supplemental sheet. \n\n\n \n26 \n \nSupplemental sheet is to be used for indicating approval or modifications of the title, the \nabstract as submitted by the applicant, and the figure to be published with the abstract. \nThe supplemental sheet is also to be completed where there are restrictions on the search, \ni.e. when claims incurring fees are not searched due to non-payment of claims fees, when \nunity of invention is lacking, or when a meaningful search is not possible such that the \nsearch report is a partial one or is completely replaced by a declaration that no meaningful \nsearch can be conducted. \n \nChapter VI: \n \nSubstantive Examination \n6.1 \nIntroduction \nThe Purpose of examination is to ensure that the application and the invention to which it \nrelates meet the requirements set out in the relevant sections of the Act and the \nRegulations. The prime task of the Examiner at this stage is to deal with the substantive \nrequirements however there he should ensure that formality requirement have been \ncomplied with. In the event that there are deficiencies of formal requirements the applicants \nshould be invited to remedy the deficiencies.  \n \nDuring substantive examination main areas of focus for the examiner include: \n(i) \nSufficiency of disclosure \n(ii) \nClaims supported by description (enabled) \n(iii) \nUnity invention \n(iv) \nNovelty  \n(v) \nInventive step \n(vi) \nIndustrial applicability \n(vii) \nMatters excluded from patentability \n(viii) \nMatters prejudicial to public order, morality, safety and environment \n6.2 \nSufficiency of disclosure \nA detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention must be given. Since \nthe application is addressed to the person skilled in the art, it is neither necessary nor \ndesirable that details of well-known ancillary features should be given, but the description \nmust disclose any feature essential for carrying out the invention in sufficient detail to render \nit apparent to the skilled person how to put the invention into practice. A single example may \nsuffice, but where the claims cover a broad field, the application should not usually be \nregarded as satisfying the requirements of section 34(5) unless the description gives a \nnumber of examples or describes alternative embodiments or variations extending over the \narea protected by the claims.  \n \nThere are some instances where even a very broad field is sufficiently exemplified by a \nlimited number of examples or even one example. In these latter cases the application must \ncontain, in addition to the examples, sufficient information to allow the person skilled in the \nart, using his common general knowledge, to perform the invention over the whole area \nclaimed without undue burden and without needing inventive skill. If the Examiner is able to \nmake out a reasoned case that the application lacks sufficient disclosure, the onus of \nestablishing that the invention may be performed and repeated over substantially the whole \nof the claimed range lies with the applicant. it is necessary that the invention is described \nnot only in terms of its structure but also in terms of its function, unless the functions of the \nvarious parts are immediately apparent. Indeed in some technical fields (e.g. computers), a \nclear description of function may be much more appropriate than an over-detailed \ndescription of structure. \n \n\n\n \n27 \nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that he supplies, on filing his application, a \nsufficient disclosure, i.e. one that meets the requirements of Section 34(5) in respect of the \ninvention as claimed in all of the claims. If the claims define the invention, or a feature \nthereof, in terms of parameters, the application as filed must include a clear description of \nthe methods used to determine the parameter values, unless a person skilled in the art \nwould know what method to use or unless all methods would yield the same result. If the \ndisclosure is seriously insufficient, such a deficiency cannot be cured subsequently by adding \nfurther examples or features without offending against Section 36(1), which requires that \namendments may not result in the introduction of subject-matter which extends beyond the \ncontent of the application as filed. Therefore, in such circumstances, the application must \nnormally be refused. If, however, the deficiency arises only in respect of some embodiments \nof the invention and not others, it could be remedied by restricting the claims to correspond \nto the sufficiently described embodiments only, the description of the remaining \nembodiments being deleted. \n6.3 \nInsufficient disclosure \n \nOccasionally applications are filed in which there is a fundamental insufficiency in the \ninvention in the sense that it cannot be carried out by a person skilled in the art; there is \nthen a failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 34(5) which is essentially irreparable. \nTwo instances deserve special mention. The first is where the successful performance of the \ninvention is dependent on chance. That is to say, the skilled person, in following the \ninstructions for carrying out the invention, finds either that the alleged results of the \ninvention are unrepeatable or that success in obtaining these results is achieved in a totally \nunreliable way. An example where this may arise is a microbiological process involving \nmutations. Such a case should be distinguished from one where repeated success is assured \neven though accompanied by a proportion of failures, as can arise e.g. in the manufacture of \nsmall magnetic cores or electronic components. In this latter case, provided the satisfactory \nparts can be readily sorted by a non-destructive testing procedure, no objection arises under \nSection 34(5). The second instance is where successful performance of the invention is \ninherently impossible because it would be contrary to well-established physical laws – this \napplies e.g. to a perpetual motion machine. If the claims for such a machine are directed to \nits function, and not merely to its structure, an objection arises not only under Section 34(5) \nbut also under section 25 in that the invention is not industrially applicable. \n6.4 \nIndustrial application \nThe description should indicate explicitly the way in which the invention is capable of \nexploitation in industry, if this is not obvious from the description or from the nature of the \ninvention. it is to be expected that, in most cases, the way in which the invention can be \nexploited in industry will be self-evident, so that no more explicit description on this point will \nbe required; but there may be a few instances, e.g. in relation to methods of testing, where \nthe manner of industrial exploitation is not apparent and must therefore be explicitly \nindicated. \nAlso, in relation to certain biotechnological inventions, i.e. sequences and partial sequences \nof genes, the industrial application is not self-evident. \nThe industrial application of such sequences must be disclosed in the patent application. \n6.5 \nManner and order of presentation \nThe manner and order of presentation of the description should be that specified in \nRegulation 13(2) unless, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a \ndifferent order would afford a better understanding and a more economic presentation.  \n \nSince the responsibility for clearly and completely describing the invention lies with the \napplicant, the examiner should not object to the presentation unless satisfied that such an \n\n\n \n28 \nobjection would be a proper exercise of his discretion. Some departure from the \nrequirements of Regulation 13(2) is acceptable, provided the description is clear and orderly \nand all the requisite information is present. Certain technically simple inventions may be fully \ncomprehensible with the minimum of description and only slight reference to prior art. \n6.6 \nTerminology \nAlthough the description should be clear and straightforward with avoidance of unnecessary \ntechnical jargon, the use of recognised terms of art is acceptable, and will often be desirable. \nLittle-known or specially formulated technical terms may be allowed provided that they are \nadequately defined and that there is no generally recognised equivalent. \n \nThis discretion may be extended to foreign terms when there is no equivalent in the \nlanguage of the proceedings. Terms already having an established meaning should not be \nallowed to be used to mean something different if this is likely to cause confusion. There \nmay, however, be circumstances where a term may legitimately be borrowed from an \nanalogous Art. Terminology and signs must be consistent throughout the application. \n6.7 \nComputer programs \nIn the particular case of inventions in the computer field, program listings in programming \nlanguages cannot be relied on as the sole disclosure of the invention. The description, as in \nother technical fields, should be written substantially in normal language, possibly \naccompanied by flow diagrams or other aids to understanding, so that the invention may be \nunderstood by those skilled in the art who are deemed not to be programming specialists. \nShort excerpts from programs written in commonly used programming languages can be \naccepted if they serve to illustrate an embodiment of the invention. \n6.8 \nPhysical values, units \nWhen the properties of a material are referred to, the relevant units should be specified if \nquantitative considerations are involved. If this is done by reference to a published standard \n(e.g. a standard of sieve sizes) and such standard is referred to by a set of initials or similar \nabbreviation, it should be adequately identified in the description.  \n \nPhysical values must be expressed in the units recognised in international practice, which is \ngenerally in the metric system, using SI units. Any values not meeting this requirement must \nalso be expressed in the units recognised in international practice (Regulation 17(20). Values \nin the inch/pound system, in general, do not meet the criterion \"recognised in international \npractice\". \n \nFor mathematical formulae the symbols in general use must be employed. For chemical \nformulae, the symbols, atomic weights and molecular formulae in general use must be \nemployed. In general, use should be made of the technical terms, signs and symbols \ngenerally accepted in the field in question. \n6.9 \nProper names, trademarks and trade names \nThe use of proper names, trademarks or trade names or similar words to refer to materials \nor articles is undesirable insofar as such words merely denote origin or where they may \nrelate to a range of different products. If such a word is used, then, where it is necessary in \norder to satisfy the requirements of Section 34(5), the product must be sufficiently identified, \nwithout reliance upon the word, to enable the invention to be carried out by the skilled \nperson at the date of filing. However, where such words have become internationally \naccepted as standard descriptive terms and have acquired a precise meaning (e.g. \"Bowden\" \ncable, \"Belleville\" washer, \"Panhard\" rod, \"teflon\" layer, \"caterpillar\" belt) they may be \nallowed without further identification of the product to which they relate. \n\n\n \n29 \n6.10 Registered trademarks \nIt is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that registered trademarks are acknowledged as \nsuch in the description. \n6.11 Reference documents \nReferences to other documents may relate either to the background art or to part of the \ndisclosure of the invention. Where the reference document relates to the background art, it \nmay be in the application as originally filed or introduced at a later date. \n  \nWhere the reference document relates directly to the disclosure of the invention (e.g. details \nof one of the components of a claimed apparatus), then the examiner should first consider \nwhether knowing what is in the reference document is in fact essential for carrying out the \ninvention as meant by Section 34(5): If not essential, the usual expression \"which is hereby \nincorporated by reference\", or any expression of the same kind, should be deleted from the \ndescription. \n \nIf matter in the document referred to is essential to satisfy the requirements of Section \n34(5), the examiner should require the deletion of the above-mentioned expression and that, \ninstead, the matter is expressly incorporated into the description, because the patent \nspecification should, regarding the essential features of the invention, be self-contained, i.e. \ncapable of being understood without reference to any other document. \n6.12 Drawings \n6.12.1  \nForm and content \nThe requirements relating to the form and content of drawings are set down in Regulation \n15. The only question likely to cause difficulty is whether the textual matter included on the \ndrawings is absolutely indispensable. In the case of circuit diagrams, block schematics and \nflow sheets, identifying catchwords for functional integers of complex systems (e.g. \n\"magnetic core store\", \"speed integrator\") may be regarded as indispensable from a practical \npoint of view if they are necessary to enable a diagram to be interpreted rapidly and clearly. \n6.12.2  \nPrinting quality \nThe examiner has also to check whether the drawings are suitable for reproduction.  \n6.12.3  \nPhotographs \nThe Act makes no express provision for photographs. They are nevertheless allowed where it \nis impossible to present in a drawing what is to be shown and provided that they are in black \nand white, directly reproducible and fulfil the applicable requirements for drawings (e.g. \npaper size, margins, etc.). Colour photographs are not accepted.  \n6.13 Inventions relating to biological material \n6.13.1  \nBiological material \nApplications relating to biological material are subject to the special provisions set out in \nRegulation 11. The term \"self-replicable matter\" means any material containing genetic \ninformation and capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system. If \nan invention involves the use of or concerns biological material which is not available to the \npublic and which cannot be described in the patent application in such a manner as to \nenable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, the disclosure is not \nconsidered to have satisfied the requirements of Section 34(5) unless the requirements of \nRegulation 11 have been met. \n\n\n \n30 \n6.13.2  \nPublic availability of biological material \nThe examiner must form an opinion as to whether or not the biological material is available \nto the public. There are several possibilities. The biological material may be known to be \nreadily available to those skilled in the art, e.g. baker's yeast or Bacillus natto, which is \ncommercially available, it may be a standard preserved strain, or other biological material \nwhich the examiner knows to have been preserved in a recognised depository and to be \navailable to the public. Alternatively, the applicant may have given in the description \nsufficient information as to the identifying characteristics of the biological material and as to \nthe prior availability in a depositary institution recognised for the purposes of Regulation 11 \nto satisfy the examiner. In any of these cases no further action is called for. If, however, the \napplicant has given no or insufficient information on public availability and the biological \nmaterial is a particular strain not falling within the known categories such as those already \nmentioned, then the examiner must assume that the biological material is not available to \nthe public. He must also examine whether the biological material could be described in the \npatent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person \nskilled in the art. \n6.13.4  \nDeposit of biological material \nIf the biological material is not available to the public and if it cannot be described in the \napplication in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled \nin the art, the examiner must check: \n(i) whether the application as filed gives such relevant information as is available to the \napplicant on the characteristics of the biological material. The relevant information under this \nprovision concerns the classification of the biological material and significant differences from \nknown biological material. For this purpose, the applicant must, to the extent available to \nhim, indicate morphological and biochemical characteristics and the proposed taxonomic \ndescription. \n \nThe information on the biological material in question which is generally known to the skilled \nperson on the date of filing is as a rule presumed to be available to the applicant and must \ntherefore be provided by him. If necessary, it has to be provided through experiments in \naccordance with the relevant standard literature.  \n \nAgainst this background, information should then be given on every further specific \nmorphological or physiological characteristic relevant for recognition and propagation of the \nbiological material, e.g. suitable media (composition of ingredients), in particular where the \nlatter are modified. \n \nAbbreviations for biological material or media are often less well known than the applicant \nassumes and should therefore be avoided or written in full at least once. \n \nIf biological material is deposited that cannot replicate itself but must be replicated in a \nbiological system (e.g. viruses, bacteriophages, plasmids, vectors or free DNA or RNA), the \nabove-mentioned information is also required for such biological system. If, for example, \nother biological material is required, such as host cells or helper viruses, that cannot be \nsufficiently described or is not available to the public, this material must also be deposited \nand characterised accordingly. In addition, the process for producing the biological material \nwithin this biological system must be indicated. \n \nIn many cases the above required information will already have been given to the depositary \ninstitution. \n \n\n\n \n31 \n6.14 Claims \n(section 34 (6)) \nThe application must contain \"one or more claims\". The claims must: \n(i) \"define the matter for which protection is sought\"; \n(ii) \"be clear and concise\"; and \n(iii) \"be supported by the description\". \n \nSince the extent of the protection conferred by a patent or application is determined by the \nterms of the claims (interpreted with the help of the description and the drawings), clarity of \nclaim is of the utmost importance. \n \n6.14 Form and content of claims \na) \nTechnical features \nThe claims must be drafted in terms of the \"technical features of the invention\". This means \nthat claims should not contain any statements relating, for example, to commercial \nadvantages or other non-technical matters, but statements of purpose should be allowed if \nthey assist in defining the invention. It is not necessary that every feature should be \nexpressed in terms of a structural limitation.  Functional features may be included provided \nthat a skilled person would have no difficulty in providing some means of performing this \nfunction without exercising inventive skill. Claims to the use of the invention, in the sense of \nthe technical application thereof, are allowable. \nb) \nTwo-part form \nRegulation 14(2) and (3) define the two-part form which a claim should have. The first part \nshould contain a statement indicating \"the designation of the subject-matter of the \ninvention\" i.e. the general technical class of apparatus, process, etc. to which the invention \nrelates, followed by a statement of \"those technical features which are necessary for the \ndefinition of the claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art\". \nThis statement of prior-art features is applicable only to independent claims and not to \ndependent claims.   \n \nIt is clear from the wording of Regulation 14 that it is necessary only to refer to those prior- \nart features which are relevant to the invention. For example, if the invention relates to a \nphotographic camera but the inventive step relates entirely to the shutter, it would be \nsufficient for the first part of the claim to read: \"A photographic camera including a focal \nplane shutter\" and there is no need to refer also to the other known features of a camera \nsuch as the lens and view-finder. The second part or \"characterising portion\" should state \nthe features which the invention adds to the prior art, i.e. the technical features for which, in \ncombination with the features stated in sub-paragraph (a) (the first part), protection is \nsought. \n \nIf a single document in the state of the art cited in the search report, reveals that one or \nmore features in the second part of the claim were already known in combination with all the \nfeatures in the first part of the claim and in that combination have the same effect as they \nhave in the full combination according to the invention, the examiner should require that \nsuch feature or features be transferred to the first part. Where, however, a claim relates to a \nnovel combination, and where the division of the features of the claim between the prior-art \npart and the characterising part could be made in more than one way without inaccuracy, \nthe applicant should not be pressed, unless there are very substantial reasons, to adopt a \ndifferent division of the features from that which he has chosen, if his version is not \nincorrect. \n \n\n\n \n32 \nc) \nFormulae and tables \nThe claims, as well as the description, may contain chemical or mathematical formulae but \nnot drawings.  \n \n6.15 Kinds of claim \na) \nCategories \nThe Act refers to different \"categories\" of claim (products, process or new use). For many \ninventions, claims in more than one category are needed for full protection. In fact, there are \nonly two basic kinds of claim, viz. claims to a physical entity (product, apparatus) and claims \nto an activity (process, use). The first basic kind of claim (\"product claim\") includes a \nsubstance or compositions (e.g. chemical compound or a mixture of compounds) as well as \nany physical entity (e.g. object, article, apparatus, machine, or system of co-operating \napparatus) which is produced by a person's technical skill. Examples are: \"a steering \nmechanism incorporating an automatic feed-back circuit ...\"; \"a woven garment comprising \n...\"; \"an insecticide consisting of X, Y, Z\"; or \"a communication system comprising a plurality \nof transmitting and receiving stations\".  \n \nThe second basic kind of claim (\"process claim\") is applicable to all kinds of activities in \nwhich the use of some material product for effecting the process is implied; the activity may \nbe exercised upon material products, upon energy, upon other processes (as in control \nprocesses) or upon living things. \n \nb) \nNumber of independent claims \nThe number of independent claims is not limited but the independent claims must relate to a \nsingle product or a single process. \n \nThe following are examples of typical situations falling within the scope of the exceptions \nfrom the principle of one independent claim per category: \n(i) \nexamples of a plurality of inter-related products  \n– plug and socket; \n– transmitter – receiver; \n– intermediate(s) and final chemical product; \n– gene – gene construct – host – protein – medicament; \n(ii) \nexample of a plurality of different inventive uses of a product or device: \n– second or further medical uses in the claim format of a \"second medical use\"-\ntype claim; \n(iii) \nexamples of alternative solutions to a particular problem: \n– a group of chemical compounds; \n– two or more processes for the manufacture of such compounds. \n \nc) \nIndependent and dependent claims \nAll applications will contain one or more independent claims directed to the essential features \nof the invention. Any such claim may be followed by one or more claims concerning \nparticular embodiments of that invention. It is evident that any claim relating to a particular \nembodiment must effectively include also the essential features of the invention, and hence \nmust include all the features of at least one independent claim. The term \"particular \nembodiment\" should be construed broadly as meaning any more specific disclosure of the \ninvention than that set out in the independent claim or claims. \n \n\n\n \n33 \nAny claim which includes all the features of any other claim is termed a \"dependent claim\". \nSuch a claim must contain, if possible at the beginning, a reference to the other claim, all \nfeatures of which it includes. Since a dependent claim does not by itself define all the \ncharacterising features of the subject-matter which it claims, expressions such as \n\"characterised in that\" or \"characterised by\" are not necessary in such a claim but are \nnevertheless permissible. A claim defining further particulars of an invention may include all \nthe features of another dependent claim and should then refer back to that claim. Also, in \nsome cases, a dependent claim may define a particular feature or features which may \nappropriately be added to more than one previous claim (independent or dependent). It \nfollows that there are several possibilities: a dependent claim may refer back to one or more \nindependent claims, to one or more dependent claims, or to both independent and \ndependent claims. \nd) \nArrangement of claims \nAll dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim and those referring back to \nseveral previous claims must be grouped together to the extent and in the most appropriate \nway possible. The arrangement must therefore be one which enables the association of \nrelated claims to be readily determined and their meaning in association to be readily \nconstrued. The examiner should object if the arrangement of claims is such as to create \nobscurity in the definition of the subject-matter to be protected. In general, however, when \nthe corresponding independent claim is allowable, the examiner should not concern himself \nunduly with the subject-matter of dependent claims, provided he is satisfied that they are \ntruly dependent and thus in no way extend the scope of protection of the invention defined \nin the corresponding independent claim. \n \ne) \nSubject-matter of a dependent claim \nIf the two-part form is used for the independent claim(s), dependent claims may relate to \nfurther details of features not only of the characterising portion but also of the preamble. \n \nf) \nAlternatives in a claim \nA claim, whether independent or dependent, may refer to alternatives, provided that the \nnumber and presentation of alternatives in a single claim does not make the claim obscure \nor difficult to construe and provided that the claim meets the requirements of unity. In case \nof a claim defining (chemical or non-chemical) alternatives, i.e. a so-called \"Markush-\ngrouping\", unity of invention should be considered to be present if the alternatives are of a \nsimilar nature and can fairly be substituted for one another. \n \ng) \nIndependent claims containing a reference to another claim \nA claim may also contain a reference to another claim even if it is not a dependent claim. \nOne example of this is a claim referring to a claim of a different category (e.g. \"Apparatus \nfor carrying out the process of claim 1 ...\", or \"Process for the manufacture of the product of \nclaim 1 ...\"). Similarly, in a situation like the plug and socket example above , a claim to the \none part referring to the other co-operating part (e.g. \"plug for co-operation with the socket \nof claim 1 ...\") is not a dependent claim. In all these examples, the examiner should carefully \nconsider the extent to which the claim containing the reference necessarily involves the \nfeatures of the claim referred to and the extent to which it does not. \n \nIn the case of a claim for a process which results in the product of a product claim, if the \nproduct claim is patentable then no separate examination for the novelty and non-\nobviousness of the process claim is necessary, provided that all features of the product as \n\n\n \n34 \ndefined in the product claim inevitably result from the claimed process. This also applies in \nthe case of a claim for the use of a product, when the product is patentable and is used with \nits features as claimed. In all other instances, the patentability of the claim referred to does \nnot necessarily imply the patentability of the independent claim containing the reference. It \nshould also be noted that if the process, product and/or use claims have different effective \ndates, a separate examination may still be necessary in view of intermediate documents. \n \n6.16 Clarity and interpretation of claims \na) \nClarity \nThe requirement that the claims must be clear applies to individual claims and also to the \nclaims as a whole. The clarity of the claims is of the utmost importance in view of their \nfunction in defining the matter for which protection is sought. Therefore, the meaning of the \nterms of a claim should, as far as possible, be clear for the person skilled in the art from the \nwording of the claim alone. In view of the differences in the scope of protection which may \nbe attached to the various categories of claims, the examiner should ensure that the wording \nof a claim leaves no doubt as to its category. \n \nb) \nInterpretation \nEach claim should be read giving the words the meaning and scope which they normally \nhave in the relevant art, unless in particular cases the description gives the words a special \nmeaning, by explicit definition or otherwise. Moreover, if such a special meaning applies, the \nexaminer should, so far as possible, require the claim to be amended whereby the meaning \nis clear from the wording of the claim alone.  The claim should also be read with an attempt \nto make technical sense out of it. Such a reading may involve a departure from the strict \nliteral meaning of the wording of the claims. \nc) \nInconsistencies \nAny inconsistency between the description and the claims should be avoided if it may throw \ndoubt on the extent of protection and therefore render the claim unclear or unsupported or \nalternatively, render the claim objectionable. Such inconsistency can be of the following \nkinds: \n(i) Simple verbal inconsistency \nFor example, there is a statement in the description which suggests that the invention is \nlimited to a particular feature but the claims are not thus limited; also, the description places \nno particular emphasis on this feature and there is no reason for believing that the feature is \nessential for the performance of the invention. In such a case, the inconsistency can be \nremoved either by broadening the description or by limiting the claims. \nSimilarly, if the claims are more limited than the description, the claims may be broadened or \nthe description may be limited. \n(ii) Inconsistency regarding apparently essential features \nFor example, it may appear, either from general technical knowledge or from what is stated \nor implied in the description, that a certain described technical feature not mentioned in an \nindependent claim is essential to the performance of the invention, or, in other words, is \nnecessary for the solution of the problem to which the invention relates. The examiner may \ndraw the attention of the applicant to the inconsistency. If, in response, the applicant shows \nconvincingly, e.g. by means of additional documents or other evidence, that the feature is in \nfact not essential, he may be allowed to retain the unamended claim and, where necessary, \nto amend the description instead. The opposite situation in which an independent claim \n\n\n \n35 \nincludes features which do not seem essential for the performance of the invention is not \nobjectionable. This is a matter of the applicant's choice. The examiner should therefore not \nsuggest that a claim be broadened by the omission of apparently inessential features; \n(iii) part of the subject-matter of the description and/or drawings is not covered \nby the claims \nFor example, the claims all specify an electric circuit employing semiconductor devices but \none of the embodiments in the description and drawings employs electronic tubes instead. In \nsuch a case, the inconsistency can normally be removed either by broadening the claims \n(assuming that the description and drawings as a whole provide adequate support for such \nbroadening) or by removing the \"excess\" subject-matter from the description and drawings. \nHowever, if examples in the description and/or drawings which are not covered by the claims \nare presented not as embodiments of the invention but as background art or examples which \nare useful for understanding the invention, the retention of these examples may be allowed. \n \nd) \nGeneral statements, \"spirit\" of invention \nGeneral statements in the description which imply that the extent of protection may be \nexpanded in some vague and not precisely defined way should be objected to. In particular, \nobjection should be raised to any statement which refers to the extent of protection being \nexpanded to cover the \"spirit\" of the invention. Objection should likewise be raised, in the \ncase where the claims are directed to a combination of features, to any statement which \nseems to imply that protection is nevertheless sought not only for the combination as a \nwhole but also for individual features or sub-combinations thereof. \n \ne) \nEssential features \nAn independent claim should specify explicitly all of the essential features needed to define \nthe invention except insofar as such features are implied by the generic terms used, e.g. a \nclaim to a \"bicycle\" does not need to mention the presence of wheels. \nIf a claim is to a process for producing the product of the invention, then the process as \nclaimed should be one which, when carried out in a manner which would seem reasonable to \na person skilled in the art, necessarily has as its end result that particular product; otherwise \nthere is an internal inconsistency and therefore lack of clarity in the claim. \nIn the case of a product claim, if the product is of a well-known kind and the invention lies in \nmodifying it in certain respects, it is sufficient that the claim clearly identifies the product and \nspecifies what is modified and in what way. Similar considerations apply to claims for an \napparatus. Where patentability depends on a technical effect, the claims must be so drafted \nas to include all the technical features of the invention which are essential for the technical \neffect. \n \nf) \nRelative terms \nIt is preferable not to use a relative or similar term such as \"thin\", \"wide\" or \"strong\" in a \nclaim unless the term has a well-recognised meaning in the particular art, e.g. \"high-\nfrequency\" in relation to an amplifier, and this is the meaning intended. Where the term has \nno well-recognised meaning it should, if possible, be replaced by a more precise wording \nfound elsewhere in the original disclosure. Where there is no basis in the disclosure for a \nclear definition and the term is not essential having regard to the invention, it should \nnormally be retained in the claim, because to excise it would generally lead to an extension \nof the subject-matter beyond the content of the application as filed. However, an unclear \nterm cannot be allowed in a claim if the term is essential having regard to the invention. \n\n\n \n36 \nEqually, an unclear term cannot be used by the applicant to distinguish his invention from \nthe prior art.  \n \ng) \nTerms like \"about\" and \"approximately\" \nParticular attention is required whenever the word \"about\" or similar terms such as \n\"approximately\" are used. Such a word may be applied, for example, to a particular value \n(e.g. \"about 200C\") or to a range (e.g.\"about x to about y\"). In each case, the examiner \nshould use his judgment as to whether the meaning is sufficiently clear in the context of the \napplication read as a whole. However, the word can only be permitted if its presence does \nnot prevent the invention from being unambiguously distinguished from the prior art with \nrespect to novelty and inventive step. \n \nh) \nTrademarks \nThe use of trade marks and similar expressions in claims should not be allowed as it may not \nbe guaranteed that the product or feature referred to is not modified while maintaining its \nname during the term of the patent. They may be allowed exceptionally if their use is \nunavoidable and they are generally recognised as having a precise meaning. \n \ni) \nOptional features \nExpressions like \"preferably\", \"for example\", \"such as\" or \"more particularly\" should be \nlooked at carefully to ensure that they do not introduce ambiguity. Expressions of this kind \nhave no limiting effect on the scope of a claim; that is to say, the feature following any such \nexpression is to be regarded as entirely optional. \n \nj) \nResult to be achieved \nThe area defined by the claims must be as precise as the invention allows. As a general \nRegulation, claims which attempt to define the invention by a result to be achieved should \nnot be allowed, in particular if they only amount to claiming the underlying technical \nproblem. However, they may be allowed if the invention either can only be defined in such \nterms or \ncannot otherwise be defined more precisely without unduly restricting the scope of the \nclaims and if the result is one which can be directly and positively verified by tests or \nprocedures adequately specified in the description or known to the person skilled in the art \nand which do not require undue experimentation For example, the invention may relate to \nan ashtray in which a smouldering cigarette end will be automatically extinguished due to \nthe shape and relative dimensions of the ashtray. The latter may vary considerably in a \nmanner difficult to define whilst still providing the desired effect. So long as the claim \nspecifies the construction and shape of the ashtray as clearly as possible, it may define the \nrelative dimensions by reference to the result to be achieved, provided that the specification \nincludes adequate directions to enable the reader to determine the required dimensions by \nroutine test procedures. It should be noted that the above-mentioned requirements for \nallowing a definition of subject-matter in terms of a result to be achieved differ from those \nfor allowing a definition of subject-matter in terms of functional features. \n \n6.17 Parameters \nWhere the invention relates to a product, it may be defined in a claim in various ways, viz. \nas a chemical product by its chemical formula, as a product of a process (if no clearer \ndefinition is possible) or, exceptionally, by its parameters. Parameters are characteristic \n\n\n \n37 \nvalues, which may be values of directly measurable properties (e.g. the melting point of a \nsubstance, the flexural strength of steel, the resistance of an electrical conductor) or may be \ndefined as more or less complicated mathematical combinations of several variables in the \nform of formulae. Characterisation of a product mainly by its parameters should only be \nallowed in those cases where the invention cannot be adequately defined in any other way, \nprovided that those parameters can be clearly and reliably determined either by indications \nin the description or by objective procedures which are usual in the art. The same applies to \na process-related feature which is defined by parameters. Cases in which unusual \nparameters are employed or a non-accessible apparatus for measuring the parameter(s) is \nused are prima facie objectionable on grounds of lack of clarity, as no meaningful \ncomparison with the prior art can be made. Such cases might also disguise lack of novelty. \nWhether the method of and the means for measurement of the parameters need also be in \nthe claim. \n \n6.18 Product-by-process claim \nClaims for products defined in terms of a process of manufacture are allowable only if the \nproducts as such fulfil the requirements for patentability, i.e. inter alia that they are new and \ninventive. A product is not rendered novel merely by the fact that it is produced by means of \na new process. A claim defining a product in terms of a process is to be construed as a claim \nto the product as such. \n \nThe claim may for instance take the form \"Product X obtainable by process Y\". Irrespective \nof whether the term \"obtainable\", \"obtained\", \"directly obtained\" or an equivalent wording is \nused in the product-by process claim, it is still directed to the product per se and confers \nabsolute protection upon the product. \n \nIf the subject-matter of a patent is a process, the protection conferred by the patent extends \nto the products directly obtained by such process. The provisions of the Act are understood \nto apply to processes producing products completely different from the starting materials as \nwell as to the processes producing only superficial changes (e.g. painting, polishing). \n \n6.19 \"Apparatus for ...\", \"Method for ...\", etc. \nIf a claim commences with such words as: \"Apparatus for carrying out the process etc...\" \nthis must be construed as meaning merely apparatus suitable for carrying out the process. \nApparatus which otherwise possesses all of the features specified in the claims but which \nwould be unsuitable for the stated purpose or would require modification to enable it to be \nso used, should normally not be considered as anticipating the claim. \n \nSimilar considerations apply to a claim for a product for a particular use. For example, if a \nclaim refers to a \"mould for molten steel\", this implies certain limitations for the mould. \nTherefore, a plastic ice cube tray with a melting point much lower than that of steel would \nnot come within the claim. Similarly, a claim to a substance or composition for a particular \nuse should be construed as meaning a substance or composition which is in fact suitable for \nthe stated use; a known product which prima facie is the same as the substance or \ncomposition defined in the claim, but which is in a form which would render it unsuitable for \nthe stated use, would not deprive the claim of novelty. However, if the known product is in a \nform in which it is in fact suitable for the stated use, though it has never been described for \nthat use, it would deprive the claim of novelty. An exception to this general principle of \ninterpretation is where the claim is to a known substance or composition for use in a \nsurgical, therapeutic or diagnostic method. \n \n\n\n \n38 \nIn contrast to an apparatus or product claim, in case of a method claim commencing with \nsuch words as: \"Method for remelting galvanic layers\" the part \"for remelting ...\" should not \nbe understood as meaning that the process is merely suitable for remelting galvanic layers, \nbut rather as a functional feature concerning the remelting of galvanic layers and, hence, \ndefining one of the method steps of the claimed method  \n \n6.20 Definition by reference to use or another entity \nWhere a claim in respect of a physical entity (product, apparatus) seeks to define the \ninvention by reference to features relating to the entity's use, a lack of clarity can result. This \nis particularly the case where the claim not only defines the entity itself but also specifies its \nrelationship to a second entity which is not part of the claimed entity (for example, a cylinder \nhead for an engine, where the former is defined by features of its location in the latter). \nBefore considering a restriction to the combination of the two entities, if should always be \nremembered that the applicant is normally entitled to independent protection of the first \nentity per se, even if it was initially defined by its relationship to the second entity.  \n \nSince the first entity can often be produced and marketed independently of the second \nentity, it will usually be possible to obtain independent protection by wording the claims \nappropriately (for example, by substituting \"connectable\" for \"connected\"). If it is not \npossible to give a clear definition of the first entity per se, then the claim should be directed \nto a combination of the first and second entities (for example, \"engine with a cylinder head\" \nor \"engine comprising a cylinder head\"). \n \nIt may also be allowable to define the dimensions and/or shape of a first entity in an \nindependent claim by general reference to the dimensions and/or corresponding shape of a \nsecond entity which is not part of the claimed first entity but is related to it through use. This \nparticularly applies where the size of the second entity is in some way standardized (for \nexample, in the case of a mounting bracket for a vehicle number plate, where the bracket \nframe and fixing elements are defined in relation to the outer shape of the number-plate). \nHowever, references to second entities which cannot be seen as subject to standardization \nmay also be sufficiently clear in cases where the skilled person would have little difficulty in \ninferring the resultant restriction of the scope of protection for the first entity (for example, \nin the case of a covering sheet for an agricultural round bale, where the length and breadth \nof the covering sheet and how it is folded are defined by reference to the bale's \ncircumference, width and diameter. \n \nIt is neither necessary for such claims to contain the exact dimensions of the second entity, \nnor do they have to refer to a combination of the first and second entities. Specifying the \nlength, width and/or height of the first entity without reference to the second would lead to \nan unwarranted restriction of the scope of protection. \n \n6.21 The expression \"in\" \nTo avoid ambiguity, particular care should be exercised when assessing claims which employ \nthe word \"in\" to define a relationship between different physical entities (product, \napparatus), or between entities and activities (process, use), or between different activities. \nExamples of claims worded in this way include the following: \n(i) \nCylinder head in a four-stroke engine; \n(ii) \nIn a telephone apparatus with an automatic dialler, dial tone detector and feature \ncontroller, the dial tone detector comprising...; \n(iii) \nIn a process using an electrode feeding means of an arc-welding apparatus, a \nmethod for controlling the arc welding current and voltage comprising the \nfollowing steps: ...; and \n\n\n \n39 \n(iv) \nIn a process/system/apparatus etc. ... the improvement consisting of... \n \nIn examples (i) to (iii) the emphasis is on the fully functioning sub-units (cylinder head, dial \ntone detector, method for controlling the arc welding current and voltage) rather than the \ncomplete unit within which the subunit is contained (four-stroke engine, telephone, process).  \n \nThis can make it unclear whether the protection sought is limited to the sub-unit per se, or \nwhether the unit as a whole is to be protected. For the sake of clarity, claims of this kind \nshould be directed either to \"a unit with (or comprising) a sub-unit\" (e.g. \"four-stroke engine \nwith a cylinder head\"), or to the subunit per se, specifying its purpose (for example, \"cylinder \nhead for a four stroke engine\"). With claims of the type indicated by example (iv), the use of \nthe word \"in\" sometimes makes it unclear whether protection is sought for the improvement \nonly or for all the features defined in the claim. Here, too, it is essential to ensure that the \nwording is clear. \n \nHowever, claims such as \"use of a substance ... as an anticorrosive ingredient in a paint or \nlacquer composition\" are acceptable on the basis of second non-medical use  \n \n6.22 Use claims \nFor the purposes of examination, a \"use\" claim in a form such as \"the use of substance X as \nan insecticide\" should be regarded as equivalent to a \"process\" claim of the form \"a process \nof killing insects using substance X\". Thus a claim in the form indicated should not be \ninterpreted as directed to the substance X recognisable (e.g. by further additives) as \nintended for use as an insecticide.  \n \nSimilarly, a claim for \"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit\" would be equivalent to \na process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the transistor and \nshould not be interpreted as being directed to \"an amplifying circuit in which the transistor is \nused\", nor to \"the process of using the transistor in building such a circuit\". \n \n6.23 References to the description or drawings \nThe claims must not, in respect of the technical features of the invention, rely on references \nto the description or drawings \"except where absolutely necessary\". In particular they must \nnot normally rely on such references as \"as described in part ... of the description\", or \"as \nillustrated in Figure 2 of the drawings\". The emphatic wording of the excepting clause should \nbe noted. The onus is upon the applicant to show that it is \"absolutely necessary\" to rely on \nreference to the description or drawings in appropriate cases. An example of an allowable \nexception would be that in which the invention involves some peculiar shape, illustrated in \nthe drawings, but which cannot be readily defined either in words or by a simple \nmathematical formula.  \n \n6.24 Method of and means for measuring parameters referred to in claims \n \nA further special case is where the invention is characterised by parameters. Provided that \nthe conditions for defining the invention in this way are met, the definition of the invention \nshould appear completely in the claim itself whenever this is reasonably practicable. In \nprinciple the method of measurement is necessary for the unambiguous definition of the \nparameter. The method of and means for measurement of the parameter values need not \nhowever be in the claims when: \n\n\n \n40 \n(i) \nthe description of the method is so long that its inclusion would make the claim \nunclear through lack of conciseness or difficult to understand; in that case the \nclaim should include a reference to the description; \n(ii) \na person skilled in the art would know which method to employ, e.g. because \nthere is only one method, or because a particular method is commonly used; or \n(iii) \nall known methods yield the same result (within the limits of measurement \naccuracy). \n \nHowever, in all other cases the method of and means for measurement should be included in \nthe claims as the claims define the matter for which protection is sought. \n \n6.25 Reference signs \n \nIf the application contains drawings, and the comprehension of the claims would be \nimproved by establishing the connection between the features mentioned in the claims and \nthe corresponding reference signs in the drawings, then appropriate reference signs should \nbe placed in parentheses after the features mentioned in the claims. If there is a large \nnumber of different embodiments, only the reference signs of the most important \nembodiments need be incorporated in the independent claim(s). \n \nWhere claims are drafted in the two-part form set out in, the reference signs should be \ninserted not only in the characterising part but also in the preamble of the claims. Reference \nsigns should not however be seen as limiting the extent of the matter protected by the \nclaims; their sole function is to make claims easier to understand.  \nIf text is added to reference signs in parentheses in the claims, lack of clarity can arise. 84). \nExpressions such as \"securing means (screw 13, nail 14)\" or \"valve assembly (valve seat 23, \nvalve element 27, valve seat 28)\" are not reference signs but are special features, that are \nnot applicable. A lack of clarity can also arise with bracketed expressions that do not include \nreference signs, e.g. \"(concrete) moulded brick\".  \n \nIn contrast, bracketed expressions with a generally accepted meaning are allowable, e.g. \n\"(meth)acrylate\" which is known as an abbreviation for \"acrylate and methacrylate\". The use \nof brackets in chemical or mathematical formulae is also unobjectionable. \n \n6.26 Negative limitations (e.g. disclaimers) \n \nA claim's subject-matter is normally defined in terms of positive features indicating that \ncertain technical elements are present. Exceptionally, however, the subject-matter may be \nrestricted using a negative limitation expressly stating that particular features are absent. \nThis may be done e.g. to remove non-patentable embodiments disclosed in the application \nas filed or if the absence of a feature can be deduced from the application as filed. \n \nNegative limitations such as disclaimers may be used only if adding positive features to the \nclaim either would not define more clearly and concisely the subject-matter still protectable \nor would unduly limit the scope of the claim. \n \nOn the other hand, if a claim for a chemical compound refers to it as \"consisting of \ncomponents A, B and C\" by their proportions expressed in percentages, the presence of any \nadditional component is excluded and therefore the percentages should add up to 100%. \n \n \n\n\n \n41 \n6.27 Conciseness, number of claims \n \nThe requirement that the claims must be concise refers to the claims in their entirety as well \nas to the individual claims. The number of claims must be considered in relation to the \nnature of the invention the applicant seeks to protect. Undue repetition of wording, e.g. \nbetween one claim and another, should be avoided by the use of the dependent form.  \n \nAs for dependent claims, while there is no objection to a reasonable number of such claims \ndirected to particular preferred features of the invention, the examiner should object to a \nmultiplicity of claims of a trivial nature. What is or what is not a reasonable number of claims \ndepends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  \n \nThe interests of the relevant public must also be borne in mind. The presentation of the \nclaims should not make it unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection \nis sought. Objection may also arise where there is a multiplicity of alternatives within a single \nclaim, if \nthis renders it unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection is sought. \n \n \n6.28 Support in Description \n6.28.1 General remarks \nThe claims must be supported by the description. This means that there must be a basis in \nthe description for the subject-matter of every claim and that the scope of the claims must \nnot be broader than is justified by the extent of the description and drawings and also the \ncontribution to the art.  \n \nMost claims are generalisations from one or more particular examples. The extent of \ngeneralisation permissible is a matter which the examiner must judge in each particular case \nin the light of the relevant prior art. \n \nThus an invention which opens up a whole new field is entitled to more generality in the \nclaims than one which is concerned with advances in a known technology. A fair statement \nof claim is one which is not so broad that it goes beyond the invention nor yet so narrow as \nto deprive the applicant of a just reward for the disclosure of his invention. The applicant \nshould be allowed to cover all obvious modifications of, equivalents to and uses of that which \nhe has described. In particular, if it is reasonable to predict that all the variants covered by \nthe claims have the properties or uses the applicant ascribes to them in the description, he \nshould be allowed to draw his claims accordingly.  \n \nAs a general rule, a claim should be regarded as supported by the description unless there \nare well-founded reasons for believing that the skilled person would be unable, on the basis \nof the information given in the application as filed, to extend the particular teaching of the \ndescription to the whole of the field claimed by using routine methods of experimentation or \nanalysis. Support must, however, be of a technical character; vague statements or assertions \nhaving no technical content provide no basis. \n \n \nThe examiner should raise an objection of lack of support only if he has well-founded \nreasons. Once the examiner has set out a reasoned case that, for example, a broad claim is \nnot supported over the whole of its breadth, the onus of demonstrating that the claim is fully \nsupported lies with the applicant.  \n \n\n\n \n42 \nWhere objection is raised, the reasons should, where possible, be supported specifically by a \npublished document. A claim in generic form, i.e. relating to a whole class, e.g. of materials \nor machines, may be acceptable even if of broad scope, if there is fair support in the \ndescription and there is no reason to suppose that the invention cannot be worked through \nthe whole of the field claimed. Where the information given appears insufficient to enable a \nperson skilled in the art to extend the teaching of the description to parts of the field claimed \nbut not explicitly described by using routine methods of experimentation or analysis, the \nexaminer should raise a reasoned objection, and invite the applicant to establish, by suitable \nresponse, that the invention can in fact be readily applied on the basis of the information \ngiven over the whole field claimed or, failing this, to restrict the claim accordingly. \n6.28.2 Lack of support vs. insufficient disclosure \nIt should be noted that, although an objection of lack of support is an objection, it can often, \nalso be considered as an objection of insufficient disclosure of the invention the objection \nbeing that the disclosure is insufficient to enable the skilled person to carry out the \n\"invention\" over the whole of the broad field claimed (although sufficient in respect of a \nnarrow \"invention\"). Both requirements are designed to reflect the principle that the terms of \na claim should be commensurate with, or be justified by, the invention.  \n \nWhether the objection is raised as lack of support or as insufficiency is unimportant in \nexamination proceedings; but it is important in opposition proceedings since there only the \nlatter ground is available. \n6.28.3 Support for dependent claims \nWhere certain subject-matter is clearly disclosed in a claim of the application as filed, but is \nnot mentioned anywhere in the description, it is permissible to amend the description so that \nit includes this subject-matter. Where the claim is dependent, it may suffice if it is mentioned \nin the description that the claim sets out a particular embodiment of the invention. \n \n \n6.29 Unity of invention \n6.29.1 General remarks \nA patent application must \"relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked \nas to form a single general inventive concept\". The second of these alternatives, i.e. the \nsingle-concept linked group, may give rise to a plurality of independent claims in the same \ncategory. \n \n6.29.2 Special technical features \nThe link between the inventions must be a technical relationship which finds expression in \nthe claims in terms of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression \n\"special technical features\" means, in any one claim, the particular technical feature or \nfeatures that define a contribution that the claimed invention considered as a whole makes \nover the prior art. Once the special technical features of each invention have been identified, \none must determine whether or not there is a technical relationship between the inventions \nand, furthermore, whether or not this relationship involves these special technical features. \nIt is not necessary that the special technical features in each invention be the same.  \n \n\n\n \n43 \n6.29.3 Intermediate and final products \nUnity of invention should be considered to be present in the context of intermediate and final \nproducts where: \n(i) the intermediate and final products have the same essential structural element, i.e. their \nbasic chemical structures are the same or their chemical structures are technically closely \ninterrelated, the intermediate incorporating an essential structural element into the final \nproduct, and \n(ii) the intermediate and final products are technically inter-related, i.e. the final product is \nmanufactured directly from the intermediate or is separated from it by a small number of \nintermediates all containing the same essential structural element. Unity of invention may \nalso be present between intermediate and final products of which the structures are not \nknown – for example, as between an intermediate having a known structure and a final \nproduct with unknown structure or as between an intermediate of unknown structure and a \nfinal product of unknown structure.  \n \nIn such cases, there should be sufficient evidence to lead one to conclude that the \nintermediate and final products are technically closely interrelated as, for example, when the \nintermediate contains the same essential element as the final product or incorporates an \nessential element into the final product. Different intermediate products used in different \nprocesses for the preparation of the final product may be claimed provided that they have \nthe same essential structural element. The intermediate and final products should not be \nseparated, in the process leading from one to the other, by an intermediate which is not \nnew. Where different intermediates for different structural parts of the final product are \nclaimed, unity should not be regarded as being present between the intermediates.  \n \nIf the intermediate and final products are families of compounds, each intermediate \ncompound should correspond to a compound claimed in the family of the final products. \nHowever, some of the final products may have no corresponding compound in the family of \nthe intermediate products, so the two families need not be absolutely congruent. The mere \nfact that, besides the ability to be used to produce final products, the intermediates also \nexhibit other possible effects or activities should not prejudice unity of invention. \n6.29.4 Markush grouping \nWhere a single claim defines (chemical or non-chemical) alternatives, i.e. a so-called \n\"Markush grouping\", unity of invention should be considered to be present if the alternatives \nare of a similar nature. When the Markush grouping is for alternatives of chemical \ncompounds, they should be regarded as being of a similar nature where: \n(i) \nall alternatives have a common property or activity; and \n(ii) \na common structure is present, i.e. a significant structural element is shared by all \nof the alternatives, or all alternatives belong to a recognised class of chemical \ncompounds in the art to which the invention pertains.  \n \nA \"significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives\" where the compounds \nshare a common chemical structure which occupies a large portion of their structures, or, in \ncase the compounds have in common only a small portion of their structures, the commonly \nshared structure constitutes a structurally distinctive portion in view of existing prior art. The \nstructural element may be a single component or a combination of individual components \nlinked together. The alternatives belong to a \"recognised class of chemical compounds\" if \nthere is an expectation from the knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave \nin the same way in the context of the claimed invention, i.e. that each member could be \nsubstituted one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be \nachieved. If it can be shown that at least one Markush alternative is not novel, unity of \ninvention should be reconsidered. \n\n\n \n44 \n6.29.5 Individual features in a claim \nObjection of lack of unity does not arise because of one claim containing a number of \nindividual features, where these features do not present a technical inter-relationship (i.e. a \ncombination), but merely a juxtaposition \n6.29.6 Dependent claims \nNo objection on account of lack of unity a is justified in respect of a dependent claim and the \nclaim on which it depends, on the ground that the general concept they have in common is \nthe subject-matter of the independent claim, which is also contained in the dependent claim. \nFor example, suppose claim 1 claims a turbine rotor blade shaped in a specified manner, \nwhile claim 2 is for a \"turbine rotor blade as claimed in claim 1 and produced from alloy Z\". \nThe common general concept linking the dependent with the independent claim is \"turbine \nrotor blade shaped in a specified manner\". \n \nIf, however, the independent claim appears not to be patentable, then the question whether \nthere is still an inventive link between all the claims dependent on that claim needs to be \ncarefully considered non-unity. It may be that the \"special technical features\" of one claim \ndependent on this non-patentable independent claim are not present in the same or \ncorresponding form in another claim dependent on that claim. \n \n6.30 Unity invention \nLack of unity during substantive examination \nThe final responsibility for establishing whether the application meets the requirement of \nunity of invention ultimately rests with the Examiner. The Examiner will normally initially \nuphold the position taken in the search opinion and will then require deletion of all the \ninventions other than that which has been searched. If the Examiner is convinced, e.g. by \narguments from the applicant, that the opinion on unity at the search stage was incorrect, \nthen an additional search is performed for that part of the subject-matter which is judged to \nbe unitary with an invention which was searched and the examination is carried out on those \nclaims which comply with the requirement of unity of invention. \n \nIf the applicant has taken the opportunity to have other inventions searched, then he may \ndetermine that the application is to proceed on the basis of any of these, the other(s) being \ndeleted. If the applicant has not yet done so, the examiner should at the beginning of \nsubstantive examination, if he maintains the objection of lack of unity, invite the applicant to \nstate on which invention the prosecution of the application should be based and to limit the \napplication accordingly by excising those parts belonging to the other inventions.  \n \nWhether or not the question of unity of invention has been raised by the Search Division, it \nmust always be considered by the Examiner. Whenever unity is found to be lacking, the \napplicant should be required to limit his claims in such a way as to overcome the objection. \nExcision or amendment of parts of the description may also be necessary. One or more \ndivisional applications, covering matter removed to meet this objection, may be filed. \n6.31 Novelty  \n6.31.1General remarks \nThe Act provides that an invention is new if it is not anticipated by prior art. Everything \nmade available to the public anywhere in, the world by means of written disclosure \n(including drawings and other illustrations) or, by oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other \nnon-written means shall be considered prior art provided that such disclosure occurred \n\n\n \n45 \nbefore the date of filing of the application or, if priority is claimed, before the priority date \nvalidly claimed in respect thereof. \n \nAn invention is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.  It \nshould be noted that in considering novelty, it is not permissible to combine separate items \nof prior art together. It is also not permissible to combine separate items belonging to \ndifferent embodiments described in one and the same document, unless such combination \nhas specifically been suggested. However, if a document (the \"primary\" document) refers \nexplicitly to another document as providing more detailed information on certain features, \nthe teaching of the latter is to be regarded as incorporated into the document containing the \nreference, if the document referred to was available to the public on the publication date of \nthe document containing the reference. The relevant date for novelty purposes, however, is \nalways the date of the primary document. It is further permissible to use a dictionary or \nsimilar document of reference in order to interpret a special term used in a document. \n6.31.2 Implicit features or well-known equivalents \nA document takes away the novelty of any claimed subject-matter derivable directly and \nunambiguously from that document including any features implicit to a person skilled in the \nart in what is expressly mentioned in the document, e.g. a disclosure of the use of rubber in \ncircumstances where clearly its elastic properties are used even if this is not explicitly stated \ntakes away the novelty of the use of an elastic material. The limitation to subject-matter \n\"derivable directly and unambiguously\" from the document is important. Thus, when \nconsidering novelty, it is not correct to interpret the teaching of a document as embracing \nwell-known equivalents which are not disclosed in the documents; this is a matter of \nobviousness. \n6.31.3 Relevant date of a prior document \nIn determining novelty, a prior document should be read as it would have been read by a \nperson skilled in the art on the relevant date of the document. By \"relevant\" date is meant \nthe publication date in the case of a previously published document and the date of filing (or \npriority date, where appropriate) in the case of a document. \n6.31.4 Enabling disclosure of a prior document \nSubject-matter described in a document can only be regarded as having been made \navailable to the public, and therefore as comprised in the state if the information given \ntherein to the skilled person is sufficient to enable him, at the relevant date of the document, \nto practice the technical teaching which is the subject of the document, taking into account \nalso the general knowledge at that time in the field to be expected of him and not published. \nSimilarly, it should be noted that a chemical compound, the name or formula of which is \nmentioned in a prior-art document, is not thereby considered as known, unless the \ninformation in the document, together, where appropriate, with knowledge generally \navailable on the relevant date of the document, enables it to be prepared and separated or, \nfor instance in the case of a product of nature, only to be separated. \n6.31.5 Generic disclosure and specific examples \nIn considering novelty, it should be borne in mind that a generic disclosure does not usually \ntake away the novelty of any specific example falling within the terms of that disclosure, but \nthat a specific disclosure does take away the novelty of a generic claim embracing that \ndisclosure, e.g. a disclosure of copper takes away the novelty of metal as a generic concept, \nbut not the novelty of any metal other than copper, and one of rivets takes away the novelty \nof fastening means as a generic concept, but not the novelty of any fastening other than \nrivets. \n\n\n \n46 \n6.31.7 Implicit disclosure and parameters \nIn the case of a prior document, the lack of novelty may be apparent from what is explicitly \nstated in the document itself. Alternatively, it may be implicit in the sense that, in carrying \nout the teaching of the prior document, the skilled person would inevitably arrive at a result \nfalling within the terms of the claim. An objection of lack of novelty of this kind should be \nraised by the examiner only where there can be no reasonable doubt as to the practical \neffect of the prior teaching (for a second nonmedical use.  \n \nSituations of this kind may also occur when the claims define the invention, or a feature \nthereof, by parameters. It may happen that in the relevant prior art a different parameter, or \nno parameter at all, is mentioned. If the known and the claimed products are identical in all \nother respects (which is to be expected if, for example, the starting products and the \nmanufacturing processes are identical), then in the first place an objection of lack of novelty \narises. If the applicant is able to show, e.g. by appropriate comparison tests, that differences \ndo exist with respect to the parameters, it is questionable whether the application discloses \nall the features essential to manufacture products having the parameters specified in the \nclaims. \n6.31.8 Examination of novelty \nIn determining novelty of the subject-matter of claims, the examiner should remember that, \nparticularly for claims directed to a physical entity, non-distinctive characteristics of a \nparticular intended use should be disregarded. For example, a claim to a substance X for use \nas a catalyst would not be considered to be novel over the same substance known as a dye, \nunless the use referred to implies a particular form of the substance (e.g. the presence of \ncertain additives) which distinguishes it from the known form of the substance. That is to \nsay, characteristics not explicitly stated, but implied by the particular use, should be taken \ninto account.  \n \nIt should further be borne in mind that a claim to the use of a known compound for a \nparticular purpose (second non-medical use) which is based on a technical effect should be \ninterpreted as including that technical effect as a functional technical feature, and is \naccordingly not open to objection, provided that such technical feature has not previously \nbeen made available to the public.  \n6.31.9 Selection inventions \nSelection inventions deal with the selection of individual elements, subsets, or sub-ranges, \nwhich have not been explicitly mentioned, within a larger known set or range. \ni) In determining the novelty of a selection, it has to be decided, whether the selected \nelements are disclosed in an individualized (concrete) form in the prior art. A selection \nfrom a single list of specifically disclosed elements does not confer novelty. However, if a \nselection from two or more lists of a certain length has to be made in order to arrive at a \nspecific combination of features then the resulting combination of features, not \nspecifically disclosed in the prior art, confers novelty (the “two lists principle”). Examples \nof such selections from two or more lists are the selection of: \n(a) individual chemical compounds from a known generic formula whereby \nthe compound selected results from the selection of specific substituents \nfrom two or more “lists” of substituents given in the known generic \nformula. The same applies to specific mixtures resulting from the selection \nof individual components from lists of components making up the prior art \nmixture; \n(b) starting materials for the manufacture of a final product; \n(c) sub-ranges of several parameters from corresponding known ranges. \n \n\n\n \n47 \n(ii) \nA sub-range selected from a broader numerical range of the prior art is considered \nnovel, if each of the following three criteria is satisfied: \na) the selected sub-range is narrow compared to the known range; \nb) the selected sub-range is sufficiently far removed from any specific examples \ndisclosed in the prior art and from the endpoints of the known range; \nc) the selected range is not an arbitrary specimen of the prior art, i.e. not a \nmere embodiment of the prior art, but another invention (purposive selection, \nnew technical teaching). \nAn effect occurring only in the claimed sub-range cannot in itself confer novelty on that \nsub-range. However, such a technical effect occurring in the selected sub-range, but \nnot in the whole of the known range, can confirm that criterion c) is met, i.e. that the \ninvention is novel and not merely a specimen of the prior art. The meaning of “narrow” \nand “sufficiently far removed” has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. The new \ntechnical effect occurring within the selected range may also be the same effect as that \nattained with the broader known range, but to a greater extent. \n(iii) In the case of overlapping ranges (e.g. numerical ranges, chemical formulae) of \nclaimed subject-matter and the prior art the same principles apply for the assessment \nof novelty as in other cases, e.g. selection inventions.  \n \nIt has to be decided which subject-matter has been made available to the public by a prior \nart disclosure and thus forms part of the state of the art. In this context, it is not only \nexamples, but the whole content of the prior art document which has to be taken into \nconsideration. As to overlapping ranges or numerical ranges of physical parameters, novelty \nis destroyed by an explicitly mentioned end-point of the known range, explicitly mentioned \nintermediate values or a specific example of the prior art in the overlap. It is not sufficient to \nexclude specific novelty destroying values known from the prior art range, it must also be \nconsidered whether the skilled person, in the light of the technical facts and taking into \naccount the general knowledge in the field to be expected from him, would seriously \ncontemplate applying the technical teaching of the prior art document in the range of \noverlap. If it can be fairly assumed that he would do so, it must be concluded that no \nnovelty exists.  \n \nThe criteria mentioned in (ii) above can be applied analogously for assessing the novelty of \noverlapping numerical ranges. As far as overlapping chemical formulae are concerned, \nnovelty is acknowledged if the claimed subject-matter is distinguished from the prior art in \nthe range of overlap by a new technical element (new technical teaching), of the reasons, \nnot published for example a specifically selected chemical residue which is covered in \ngeneral terms by the prior art in the overlapping area, but which is not individualised in the \nprior art document. If this is not the case, then it must be considered whether the skilled \nperson would seriously contemplate working in the range of overlap and/or would accept \nthat the area of overlap is directly and unambiguously disclosed in an implicit manner in the \nprior art, not published. If the answer is yes, then novelty is lacking. \n6.32 Non-Prejudicial Disclosures \n6.32.1 General Remark \nThere are two specific instances (and these are the only two) in  which a prior disclosure of \nthe invention is not taken into consideration as part of the state of the art, viz. where the \ndisclosure was due to, or in consequence of: \n \n(i) \nan evident abuse in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor – e.g. the \ninvention was derived from the applicant and disclosed against his wish (Section \n23(4)(a)); or \n\n\n \n48 \n(ii) \nthe display of the invention by the applicant or his legal predecessor at an \nofficially recognized international exhibition as defined in Section 23(4)(b) of .  \n6.32.2 Time limit \nAn essential condition, in both instances (i) and (ii), is that the disclosure in point must have \ntaken place not earlier than twelve months preceding the filing of the application. For \ncalculating the twelve-month period the relevant date is that of the actual filing date of the \npatent application (Section 23(4)). \n6.32.3 Evident abuse \nRegarding instance (i), the disclosure might be made in a published document or in any \nother way. As a particular instance, the disclosure might be made in a European application \nof earlier priority date. Thus, for example, a person B who has been told of A's invention in \nconfidence, might himself apply for a patent for this invention. If so, the disclosure resulting \nfrom the publication of B's application will not prejudice A's rights provided that A has \nalready made an application, or applies within twelve months of such publication. B may not \nbe entitled to proceed with his application. For \"evident abuse\" to be established, there must \nbe, on the part of the person disclosing the invention, either actual intent to cause harm or \nactual or constructive knowledge that harm would or could ensue from this disclosure. \n6.32.4 International exhibition \nIn instance (ii), the application must be filed within twelve months of the disclosure of the \ninvention at the exhibition if the display is not to prejudice the application. Furthermore, the \napplicant must state, at the time of filing the application, that the invention has been so \ndisplayed, and must also file a supporting certificate.  \n6.33 Inventive Step (Section 24) \n6.33.1 General \nAn invention is considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the state of the \nart, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art. Novelty and inventive step are different \ncriteria. Novelty exists if there is any difference between the invention and the known art. \nThe question – \"is there inventive step?\" – only arises if there is novelty.  \n6.33.2 State of the art; date of filing \nThe \"state of the art\" for the purposes of considering inventive step does not include later \npublished patent applications. Date of filing - means date of priority where appropriate. \n6.33.3 Person skilled in the art \nThe \"person skilled in the art\" should be presumed to be an ordinary practitioner aware of \nwhat was common general knowledge in the art at the relevant date. He should also be \npresumed to have had access to everything in the \"state of the art\", in particular the \ndocuments cited in the search report, and to have had at his disposal the normal means and \ncapacity for routine work and experimentation. If the problem prompts the person skilled in \nthe art to seek its solution in another technical field, the specialist in that field is the person \nqualified to solve the problem. The assessment of whether the solution involves an inventive \nstep must therefore be based on that specialist's knowledge and ability. There may be \ninstances where it is more appropriate to think in terms of a group of persons, e.g. a \nresearch or production team, than a single person. This may apply, for example, in certain \nadvanced technologies such as computers or telephone systems and in highly specialized \nprocesses such as the commercial production of integrated circuits or of complex chemical \nsubstances. (definition should be considered further) \n\n\n \n49 \n6.33.4 Obviousness \nThus the question to consider, in relation to any claim defining the invention, is whether \nbefore the filing or priority date valid for that claim, having regard to the art known at the \ntime, it would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art to arrive at something \nfalling within the terms of the claim. If so, the claim is not allowable for lack of inventive \nstep. The term \"obvious\" means that which does not go beyond the normal progress of \ntechnology but merely follows plainly or logically from the prior art, i.e. something which \ndoes not involve the exercise of any skill or ability beyond that to be expected of the person \nskilled in the art. In considering inventive step, as distinct from novelty, it is fair to construe \nany published document in the light of subsequent knowledge and to have regard to all the \nknowledge generally available to the person skilled in the art the day before the filing or \npriority date valid for the claimed invention. \n6.33.5 Combination vs. juxtaposition or aggregation \nThe invention claimed must normally be considered as a whole. When a claim consists of a \n\"combination of features\", it is not correct to argue that the separate features of the \ncombination taken by themselves are known or obvious and that \"therefore\" the whole \nsubject-matter claimed is obvious. However, where the claim is merely an \"aggregation or \njuxtaposition of features\" and not a true combination, it is enough to show that the \nindividual features are obvious to prove that the aggregation of features does not involve an \ninventive step.  \nA set of technical features is regarded as a combination of features if the functional \ninteraction between the features achieves a combined technical effect which is different, e.g. \ngreater than the sum of the technical effects of the individual features. In other words, the \ninteractions of the individual features must produce a synergistic effect. If no such \nsynergistic effect exists, there is no more than a mere aggregation of features. For example, \nthe technical effect of an individual transistor is essentially that of an electronic switch. \nHowever, transistors interconnected to form a microprocessor synergically interact to achieve \ntechnical effects, such as data processing, which are over and above the sum of their \nrespective individual technical effects. \n6.33.6 Origin of an invention \nWhile the claim should in each case be directed to technical features (and not, for example, \nmerely to an idea), in order to assess whether an inventive step is present it is important for \nthe examiner to bear in mind that there are various ways in which the skilled person may \narrive at an invention. An invention may, for example, be based on the following: \n(i) The formulation of a new idea or of a yet unrecognised problem to be solved \n(the solution being obvious once the problem is clearly stated); \nExample: Appropriate tests by the applicant revealed that the effect of a known chemical \nformulation was no longer satisfactory after prolonged storage, the claimed solution being \nretrospectively trivial and in itself obvious.  \n(ii)  \nThe devising of a solution to a known problem;  \nExample: the problem of permanently marking farm animals such as cows without causing \npain to the animals or damage to the hide has existed since farming began. The solution \n(\"freeze-branding\") consists in applying the discovery that the hide can be permanently \ndepigmented by freezing. \n(iii)  \nThe arrival at an insight into the cause of an observed phenomenon (the \npractical use of this phenomenon then being obvious);  \nExample: the agreeable flavour of butter is found to be caused by minute quantities of a \nparticular compound. As soon as this insight has been arrived at, the technical application \ncomprising adding this compound to margarine is immediately obvious. Many inventions are \n\n\n \n50 \nof course based on a combination of the above possibilities - e.g. the arrival at an insight \nand the technical application of that insight may both involve the use of the inventive faculty. \n6.33.7 Problem-and –Solution Approach \nIn practice, in order to assess inventive step in an objective and predictable manner, the \nexaminer should normally apply the so-called \"problem-and-solution approach\". In the \nproblem-and-solution approach, there are three main stages: \n(i) \ndetermining the \"closest prior art\", \n(ii) \nestablishing the \"objective technical problem\" to be solved, and \n(iii) \nconsidering whether or not the claimed invention, starting from the closest prior \nart and the objective technical problem, would have been obvious to the skilled \nperson. \n6.33.8 Determination of the closest prior art \nThe closest prior art is that combination of features, disclosed in one single reference, which \nconstitutes the most promising starting point for an obvious development leading to the \ninvention. In selecting the closest prior art, the first consideration is that it should be \ndirected to a similar purpose or effect as the invention or at least belong to the same or a \nclosely related technical field as the claimed invention. In practice, the closest prior art is \ngenerally that which corresponds to a similar use and requires the minimum of structural and \nfunctional modifications to arrive at the claimed invention. \nThe closest prior art must be assessed from the skilled person's point of view on the day \nbefore the filing or priority date valid for the claimed invention. In identifying the closest \nprior art, account should be taken of what the applicant himself acknowledges in his \ndescription and claims to be known. Any such acknowledgement of known art should be \nregarded by the examiner as being correct, unless the applicant states he has made a \nmistake. \n6.33.9 Formulation of the objective technical problem \nIn the second stage, one establishes in an objective way the technical problem to be solved. \nTo do this one studies the application (or the patent), the closest prior art and the difference \n(also called \"the distinguishing feature(s)\" of the invention) in terms of features (either \nstructural or functional) between the invention and the closest prior art and then formulates \nthe technical problem. Features which cannot be seen to make any contribution, either \nindependently or in combination with other features, to the solution of a technical problem \nare not relevant for assessing inventive step. Such a situation can occur for instance if a \nfeature only contributes to the solution of a non-technical problem, for instance a problem in \na field excluded from patentability. In the context of the problem-and-solution approach, the \ntechnical problem means the aim and task of modifying or adapting the closest prior art to \nprovide the technical effects that the invention provides over the closest prior art. The \ntechnical problem thus defined is often referred to as the \"objective technical problem\". \n \nThe objective technical problem derived in this way may not be what the applicant presented \nas \"the problem\" in his application. The latter may require reformulation, since the objective \ntechnical problem is based on objectively established facts, in particular appearing in the \nprior art revealed in the course of the proceedings, which may be different from the prior art \nof which the applicant was actually aware at the time the application was filed. In particular, \nthe prior art cited in the search report may put the invention in an entirely different \nperspective from that apparent from reading the application only. The extent to which such \nreformulation of the technical problem is possible has to be assessed on the merits of each \nparticular case. As a matter of principle any effect provided by the invention may be used as \na basis for the reformulation of the technical problem, as long as said effect is derivable from \nthe application as filed. It is also possible to rely on new effects submitted subsequently \n\n\n \n51 \nduring the proceedings by the applicant, provided that the skilled person would recognise \nthese effects as implied by or related to the technical problem initially suggested. \n \nIt is noted that the objective technical problem must be so formulated as not to contain \npointers to the solution, since including part of a solution offered by an invention in the \nstatement of the problem must, when the state of the art is assessed in terms of that \nproblem, necessarily result in an ex post facto view being taken of inventive activity. The \nexpression \"technical problem\" should be interpreted broadly; it does not necessarily imply \nthat the solution is a technical improvement over the prior art. Thus the problem could be \nsimply to seek an alternative to a known device or process providing the same or similar \neffects or which is more cost-effective. Sometimes, the objective technical problem must be \nregarded as an aggregation of a plurality of \"partial problems\". This is the case where there \nis no technical effect achieved by all the distinguishing features taken in combination, but \nrather a plurality of partial problems is independently solved by different sets of \ndistinguishing features. \n6.33.10 \nCould-would approach \nIn the third stage the question to be answered is whether there is any teaching in the prior \nart as a whole that would (not simply could, but would) have prompted the skilled person, \nfaced with the objective technical problem, to modify or adapt the closest prior art while \ntaking account of that teaching, thereby arriving at something falling within the terms of the \nclaims, and thus achieving what the invention achieves. In other words, the point is not \nwhether the skilled person could have arrived at the invention by adapting or modifying the \nclosest prior art, but whether he would have done so because the prior art incited him to do \nso in the hope of solving the objective technical problem or in expectation of some \nimprovement or advantage. This must have been the case for the skilled person before the \nfiling or priority date valid for the claim under examination.  \n6.33.11 \nCombining prior-art documents \nIt is permissible to combine the disclosure of one or more documents, parts of documents or \nother pieces of prior art (e.g. a public prior use) with the closest prior art. However, the fact \nthat more than one disclosure must be combined with the closest prior art in order to arrive \nat a combination of features may be the sign of the presence of an inventive step. A \ndifferent situation occurs where the invention is a solution to a plurality of independent \n\"partial problems\". Indeed, in such a case it is necessary to separately assess, for each \npartial problem, whether the combination of features solving the partial problem is obviously \nderivable from the prior art. Hence, a different document can be combined with the closest \nprior art for each partial problem. For the subject-matter of the claim to be inventive, it \nsuffices however that one of these combinations of features involves an inventive step. In \ndetermining whether it would be obvious to combine two or more distinct disclosures, the \nexaminer should also have regard in particular to the following: \n(i) \nwhether the content of the disclosures (e.g. documents) is such as to make it \nlikely or unlikely that the person skilled in the art, when faced with the problem \nsolved by the invention, would combine them - for example, if two disclosures \nconsidered as a whole could not in practice be readily combined because of \ninherent incompatibility in disclosed features essential to the invention, the \ncombining of these disclosures should not normally be regarded as obvious; \n(ii) \nwhether the disclosures, e.g. documents, come from similar, neighbouring or \nremote technical fields; \n(iii) \nthe combining of two or more parts of the same document would be obvious if \nthere is a reasonable basis for the skilled person to associate these parts with one \nanother. It would normally be obvious to combine with a prior-art document a \nwell-known textbook or standard dictionary; this is only a special case of the \ngeneral proposition that it is obvious to combine the teaching of one or more \n\n\n \n52 \ndocuments with the common general knowledge in the art. It would, generally \nspeaking, also be obvious to combine two documents one of which contains a \nclear and unmistakable reference to the other. In determining whether it is \npermissible to combine a document with an item of prior art made public in some \nother way, e.g. by use, similar considerations apply. \n6.33.12 \nIndicators \nPredictable disadvantage; non-functional modification; arbitrary choice It should be noted \nthat if the invention is the result of a foreseeable disadvantageous modification of the closest \nprior art, which the skilled person could clearly predict and correctly assess, and if this \npredictable disadvantage is not accompanied by an unexpected technical advantage, then \nthe claimed invention does not involve an inventive step. In other words, a mere foreseeable \nworsening of the prior art does not involve an inventive step. However, if this worsening is \naccompanied by an unexpected technical advantage, an inventive step might be present. \nSimilar considerations apply to the case where an invention is merely the result of an \narbitrary non-functional modification of a prior-art device or of a mere arbitrary choice from \na host of possible solutions. \n \nIt should be remembered that an invention which at first sight appears obvious might in fact \ninvolve an inventive step. Once a new idea has been formulated it can often be shown \ntheoretically how it might be arrived at, starting from something known, by a series of \napparently easy steps. The examiner should be wary of ex post facto analysis of this kind. \nHe should always bear in mind that the documents produced in the search have, of \nnecessity, been obtained with foreknowledge of what matter constitutes the alleged \ninvention. In all cases he should attempt to visualise the overall state of the art confronting \nthe skilled person before the applicant's contribution and he should seek to make a \"real-life\" \nassessment of this and other relevant factors. He should take into account all that is known \nconcerning the background of the invention and give fair weight to relevant arguments or \nevidence submitted by the applicant. If, for example, an invention is shown to be of \nconsiderable technical value, and particularly if it provides a technical advantage which is \nnew and surprising and which is not merely achieved as a bonus effect in a \"one-way street\" \nsituation, and this technical advantage can convincingly be related to one or more of the \nfeatures included in the claim defining the invention, the examiner should be hesitant in \npursuing an objection that such a claim lacks inventive step. \n6.33.13 \nUnexpected technical effect; bonus effect \nAn unexpected technical effect may be regarded as an indication of inventive step. However, \nif, having regard to the state of the art, it would already have been obvious for a skilled \nperson to arrive at something falling within the terms of a claim, for example due to a lack of \nalternatives thereby creating a \"one-way street\" situation, the unexpected effect is merely a \nbonus effect which does not confer inventiveness on the claimed subject-matter. \n6.33.14 \nLong-felt need; commercial success \nWhere the invention solves a technical problem which workers in the art have been \nattempting to solve for a long time, or otherwise fulfils a long-felt need, this may be \nregarded as an indication of inventive step. Commercial success alone is not to be regarded \nas indicative of inventive step, but evidence of immediate commercial success when coupled \nwith evidence of a long-felt want is of relevance provided the examiner is satisfied that the \nsuccess derives from the technical features of the invention and not from other influences \n(e.g. selling techniques or advertising). \n\n\n \n53 \n6.33.15 \nArguments and evidence submitted by the applicant \nThe relevant arguments and evidence to be considered by the examiner for assessing \ninventive step may either be taken from the originally-filed patent application or submitted \nby the applicant during the subsequent proceedings. Care must be taken, however, \nwhenever new effects in support of inventive step are referred to. Such new effects can only \nbe taken into account if they are implied by or at least related to the technical problem \ninitially suggested in the originally filed application. Example of such a new effect: The \ninvention as filed relates to a pharmaceutical composition having a specific activity. At first \nsight, having regard to the relevant prior art, it would appear that there is a lack of inventive \nstep. Subsequently, the applicant submits new evidence which shows that the claimed \ncomposition exhibits an unexpected advantage in terms of low toxicity. In this case, it is \nallowable to reformulate the technical problem by including the aspect of toxicity, since \npharmaceutical activity and toxicity are related in the sense that the skilled person would \nalways contemplate the two aspects together. The reformulation of the technical problem \nmay or may not give rise to amendment or insertion of the statement of the technical \nproblem in the description. Any such amendment is only allowable if it satisfies the set out \nconditions. In the above example of a pharmaceutical composition, neither the reformulated \nproblem nor the information on toxicity could be introduced into the description without \ninfringing. \n6.33.16 \nSelection inventions \nThe subject-matter of selection inventions differs from the closest prior art in that it \nrepresents selected sub-sets or sub-ranges. If this selection is connected to a particular \ntechnical effect, and if no hints exist leading the skilled person to the selection, then an \ninventive step is accepted (this technical effect occurring within the selected range may also \nbe the same effect as attained with the broader known range, but to an unexpected degree). \nThe criterion of \"seriously contemplating\" mentioned in connection with the test for novelty \nof overlapping ranges should not be confused with the assessment of inventive step. For \ninventive step, it has to be considered whether the skilled person would have made the \nselection or would have chosen the overlapping range in the hope of solving the underlying \ntechnical problem or in expectation of some improvement or advantage. If the answer is \nnegative, then the claimed matter involves an inventive step. \n \n6.33.17 \nDependent claims; claims in different categories \nIf an independent claim is new and non-obvious, there is no need to investigate the novelty \nand the non-obviousness of any claims dependent thereon, except in situations where the \nsubject-matter of a dependent claim has a later effective date than the independent claim \nand intermediate documents are to be considered. Similarly, if a claim to a product is new \nand non-obvious there is no need to investigate the novelty and non-obviousness of any \nclaims for a process which inevitably results in the manufacture of that product or of any \nclaims for a use of that product. In particular, analogy processes, i.e. processes which \nthemselves would otherwise not involve an inventive step, are nevertheless patentable \ninsofar as they provide a novel and inventive product. It should, however, be noted that in \ncases where the product, process and use claims have different effective dates, a separate \nexamination as to novelty and inventive step may still be necessary in view of intermediate  \ndocuments. \n \nExamples of circumstances where an invention may be regarded as obvious or where it may \ninvolve an inventive step: \nThese examples are for illustrative purposes and that the applicable principle in each case is \n\"was it obvious to a person skilled in the art?\". Examiners should avoid attempts to fit a \n\n\n \n54 \nparticular case into one of these examples if it is not clearly applicable. Also, the list is not \nexhaustive. \n \n \nExamples Relating to the Requirement of Inventive Step-\nIndicators \n1. Application of known measures? \n \n1.1 Inventions involving the application of known measures in an obvious way \nand in respect of which an inventive step is therefore to be ruled out: \n(i) the teaching of a prior document is incomplete and at least one of the possible ways of \n\"filling the gap\" which would naturally or readily occur to the skilled person results in the \ninvention; \nExample: The invention relates to a building structure made from aluminium. A prior \ndocument discloses the same structure and says that it is of light-weight material but fails to \nmention the use of aluminium. \n(ii) the invention differs from the known art merely in the use of well-known equivalents \n(mechanical, electrical or chemical);  \nExample: The invention relates to a pump which differs from a known pump solely in that \nits motive power is provided by a hydraulic motor instead of an electric motor. \n(iii) the invention consists merely in a new use of a well-known material employing the \nknown properties of that material; (is it this simple?) \nExample: Washing composition containing as detergent a known compound having the \nknown property of lowering the surface tension of water, this property being known to be an \nessential one for detergents. \n(iv) the invention consists in the substitution in a known device of a recently developed \nmaterial whose properties make it plainly suitable for that use (\"analogous substitution\");  \nExample: An electric cable comprises a polyethylene sheath bonded to a metallic shield by \nan adhesive. The invention lies in the use of a particular newly developed adhesive known to \nbe suitable for polymer-metal bonding. \n(v) the invention consists merely in the use of a known technique in a closely analogous \nsituation (\"analogous use\"). \nExample: The invention resides in the application of a pulse control technique to the electric \nmotor driving the auxiliary mechanisms of an industrial truck, such as a fork-lift truck, the \nuse of this technique to control the electric propulsion motor of the truck being already \nknown. \n \n1.2 Inventions involving the application of known measures in a non-obvious way \nand in respect of which an inventive step is therefore to be recognised: \n(i) a known working method or means when used for a different purpose involves a new, \nsurprising effect; \nExample: It is known that high-frequency power can be used in inductive butt welding. It \nshould therefore be obvious that high-frequency power could also be used in conductive butt \nwelding with similar effect. However, if high-frequency power were used for the continuous \nconductive butt welding of coiled strip but without removing scale (such scale removal \nnormally being necessary during conductive welding in order to avoid arcing between the \nwelding contact and the strip), there is the unexpected additional effect that scale removal is \nfound to be unnecessary because at high frequency the current is supplied in a \n\n\n \n55 \npredominantly capacitive manner via the scale which forms a dielectric. In that case, an \ninventive step would exist. \n(ii) a new use of a known device or material involves overcoming technical difficulties not \nresolvable by routine techniques. \nExample: The invention relates to a device for supporting and controlling the rise and fall of \ngas holders, enabling the previously employed external guiding framework to be dispensed \nwith. A similar device was known for supporting floating docks or pontoons but practical \ndifficulties not encountered in the known applications needed to be overcome in applying the \ndevice to a gas holder. \n \n2. Obvious combination of features? \n2.1 Obvious and consequently non-inventive combination of features: \nThe invention consists merely in the juxtaposition or association of known devices or \nprocesses functioning in their normal way and not producing any non-obvious working inter-\nrelationship. \nExample: Machine for producing sausages consists of a known mincing machine and a \nknown filling machine disposed side by side. \n2.2 Not obvious and consequently inventive combination of features: \nThe combined features mutually support each other in their effects to such an extent that a \nnew technical result is achieved. It is irrelevant whether each individual feature is fully or \npartly known by itself. However, if the combination of features is a bonus effect, e.g. as the \nresult of a \"one-way street\" situation, the combination might lack an inventive step. \nExample: A mixture of medicines consists of a painkiller (analgesic) and a tranquillizer \n(sedative). It was found that through the addition of the tranquillizer, which intrinsically \nappeared to have no painkilling effect, the analgesic effect of the painkiller was intensified in \na way which could not have been predicted from the known properties of the active \nsubstances. \n3. Obvious selection? \n3.1 Obvious and consequently non-inventive selection among a number of known \npossibilities: \n(i) the invention consists merely in choosing from a number of equally likely alternatives; \nExample: The invention relates to a known chemical process in which it is known to supply \nheat electrically to the reaction mixture. There are a number of well-known alternative ways \nof so supplying the heat, and the invention resides merely in the choice of one alternative. \n \n(ii) the invention resides in the choice of particular dimensions, temperature ranges or other \nparameters from a limited range of possibilities, and it is clear that these parameters could \nbe arrived at by routine trial and error or by the application of normal design procedures; \nExample: The invention relates to a process for carrying out a known reaction and is \ncharacterized by a specified rate of flow of an inert gas. The prescribed rates are merely \nthose which would necessarily be arrived at by the skilled practitioner. \n \n(iii) the invention can be arrived at merely by a simple extrapolation in a straightforward way \nfrom the known art; \nExample: The invention is characterised by the use of a specified minimum content of a \nsubstance X in a preparation Y in order to improve its thermal stability, and this \ncharacterizing feature can be derived merely by extrapolation on a straightline graph, \nobtainable from the known art, relating thermal stability to the content of substance X. \n\n\n \n56 \n(iv) the invention consists merely in selecting particular chemical compounds or compositions \n(including alloys) from a broad field: \nExample: The prior art includes disclosure of a chemical compound characterized by a \nspecified structure including a substituent group designated \"R\". This substituent \"R\" is \ndefined so as to embrace entire ranges of broadly-defined radical groups such as all alkyl or \naryl radicals either unsubstituted or substituted by halogen and/or hydroxy, although for \npractical reasons only a very small number of specific examples are given. The invention \nconsists in the selection of a particular radical or particular group of radicals from amongst \nthose referred to as the substituent \"R\" (the selected radical or group of radicals not being \nspecifically disclosed in the prior-art document since the question would then be one of lack \nof novelty rather than obviousness). The resulting compounds: \n(a) are neither described as having nor shown to possess any advantageous properties not \npossessed by the prior art examples; or \n(b) are described as possessing advantageous properties compared with the compounds \nspecifically referred to in the prior art, but these properties are ones which the person skilled \nin the art would expect such compounds to possess, so that he is likely to be led to make \nthis selection. \n3.2 Not obvious and consequently inventive selection among a number of known \npossibilities: \n(i) the invention involves special selection in a process of particular operating conditions (e.g. \ntemperature and pressure) within a known range, such selection producing unexpected \neffects in the operation of the process or the properties of the resulting product; \nExample: In a process where substance A and substance B are transformed at high \ntemperature into substance C, it was known that there is in general a constantly increased \nyield of substance C as the temperature increases in the range between 50 and 130 °C. It is \nnow found that in the temperature range from 63 to 65 °C, which previously had not been \nexplored, the yield of substance C was considerably higher than expected. \n \n(ii) the invention consists in selecting particular chemical compounds or compositions \n(including alloys) from a broad field, such compounds or compositions having unexpected \nadvantages. \nExample: In the example of a substituted chemical compound given at (iv) under 3.1 above, \nthe invention again resides in the selection of the substituent radical \"R\" from the total field \nof possibilities defined in the prior disclosure. In this case, however, not only does the \nselection embrace a particular area of the possible field, and result in compounds that can be \nshown to possess advantageous properties (see IV, 9.11 and VI, 5.3.5) but there are no \nindications which would lead the person skilled in the art to this particular selection rather \nthan any other in order to achieve the advantageous properties. \n4. Overcoming a technical prejudice? \nAs a general rule, there is an inventive step if the prior art leads the person skilled in the art \naway from the procedure proposed by the invention. This applies in particular when the \nskilled person would not even consider carrying out experiments to determine whether these \nwere alternatives to the known way of overcoming a real or imagined technical obstacle. \n6.34  \nIndustrial application \nUnder section 25 of the Act, an invention shall be considered industrially applicable if it can \nbe made or used in any kind of industry, including agriculture, medicine, fisheries and other \nservices. \n \n\n\n \n57 \n\"Industry\" should be understood in its broad sense as including any physical activity of \n\"technical character\", that is an activity which belongs to the useful or practical arts as \ndistinct from the aesthetic arts; it does not necessarily imply the use of a machine or the \nmanufacture of an article and could cover e.g. a process for dispersing fog or for converting \nenergy from one form to another.  \n \nSection 25 excludes from patentability very few \"inventions\" which are not already excluded \nby the list in section 21(3). One further class of \"invention\" which would be excluded, \nhowever, would be articles or processes alleged to operate in a manner clearly contrary to \nwell-established physical laws, e.g. a perpetual motion machine.  \n \nObjection could arise under section 25 only insofar as the claim specifies the intended \nfunction or purpose of the invention, but if, say, a perpetual motion machine is claimed \nmerely as an article having a particular specified construction then objection should be made \nunder Art.83. \n6.34.1 Surgery, therapy and diagnostic methods \nMethods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic \nmethods practised on the human or animal body shall not be regarded as inventions which \nare industrially applicable. This provision shall not apply to products, in particular substances \nor compositions, for use in any of these methods. Hence, patents may be obtained for \nsurgical, therapeutic or diagnostic instruments or apparatuses for use in such methods. The \nmanufacture of prostheses or artificial limbs could be patentable. For instance, a method of \nmanufacturing insoles in order to correct the posture or a method of manufacturing an \nartificial limb should be patentable. In both cases, taking the imprint of the footplate or a \nmoulding of the stump on which an artificial limb is fitted is clearly not of a surgical nature \nand does not require the presence of a medically qualified person. Furthermore, the insoles \nas well as the artificial limb are manufactured outside the body. However, a method of \nmanufacturing an endoprosthesis outside the body, but requiring a surgical step to be \ncarried out for taking measurements, would be excluded from patentability. \n \nPatents may also be obtained for new products for use in methods of treatment or diagnosis, \nparticularly substances or compositions. However, in the case of a known substance or \ncomposition, this may only be patented for use in methods if the known substance or \ncomposition was not previously disclosed for use in surgery, therapy or diagnostic methods \npractised on the human or animal body (\"first medical use\").  \n \nThe same substance or composition cannot subsequently be patented for any other use of \nthat kind. A claim to a known substance or composition for the first use in surgical, \ntherapeutic and/or diagnostic methods should be in a form such as: \"Substance or \ncomposition X\" followed by the indication of the use, for instance \"... for use as a \nmedicament\", \"... as an antibacterial agent \" or \"... for curing disease Y\".  \n \nThese types of claims will be regarded as restricted to the substance or composition when \npresented or packaged for the use. However, this does not mean that product claims for first \nmedical use need not fulfil all other requirements of patentability, especially that of inventive \nstep. \n \nA claim in the form \"Use of substance or composition X for the treatment of disease Y ...\" \nwill be regarded as relating to a method for treatment explicitly excluded from patentability \nby Section 21(3)(c) and therefore will not be accepted. \nIf an application discloses for the first time a number of distinct surgical, therapeutic or \ndiagnostic uses for a known substance or composition, normally in the one application \n\n\n \n58 \nindependent claims each directed to the substance or composition for one of the various \nuses may be allowed; that is an a priori objection of lack of unity of invention should not, as \na general rule, be raised. \n \nA claim in the form \"Use of a substance or composition X for the manufacture of a \nmedicament for therapeutic application Z\" is allowable for either a first or \"subsequent\" \n(second or further) such application (\"second medical use\"-type of claim or \"Swiss-type\" \nclaim), if this application is new and inventive. The same applies to claims in the form \n\"Method for manufacturing a medicament intended for therapeutic application Z, \ncharacterised in that the substance X is used\" or the substantive equivalents thereof. In \ncases where an applicant simultaneously discloses more than one \"subsequent\" therapeutic \nuse, claims of the above type directed to these different uses are allowable in the one \napplication, but only if they form a single general inventive concept. Regarding use or \nmethod claims of the above type, it should also be noted that a mere pharmaceutical effect \ndoes not necessarily imply a therapeutical application.  \n \nFor instance, the selective occupation of a specific receptor by a given substance cannot be \nconsidered in itself as a therapeutic application; indeed, the discovery that a substance \nselectively binds a receptor, even if representing an important piece of scientific knowledge, \nstill needs to find an application in the form of a defined, real treatment of a pathological \ncondition in order to make a technical contribution to the art and to be considered as an \ninvention eligible for patent protection. \nLimitations of exclusion under Section 21(3)(c) \nIt should be noted that Section 21(3)(c) excludes only methods of treatment by surgery or \ntherapy and diagnostic methods. It follows that other methods of treatment of live human \nbeings or animals (e.g. treatment of a sheep in order to promote growth, to improve the \nquality of mutton or to increase the yield of wool) or other methods of measuring or \nrecording characteristics of the human or animal body are patentable provided that (as \nwould probably be the case) such methods are of a technical and not essentially biological \ncharacter and are industrially applicable. The latter proviso is particularly important in the \ncase of human beings. For example, an application with a claim for a method of \ncontraception, which is to be applied in the private and personal sphere of a human being, is \nnot industrially applicable. However, an application containing claims directed to the purely \ncosmetic treatment of a human by administration of a chemical product is considered \nindustrially applicable. A cosmetic treatment involving surgery or therapy would, however, \nnot be patentable. \n \nIn order to be excluded, a treatment or diagnostic method must actually be carried out on \nthe living human or animal body. A treatment of or diagnostic method practised on a dead \nhuman or animal body would therefore not be excluded from patentability by virtue of \nSection 21(3)(c). \nTreatment of body tissues or fluids after they have been removed from the human or animal \nbody, or diagnostic methods applied thereon, are not excluded from patentability insofar as \nthese tissues or fluids are not returned to the same body. Thus the treatment of blood for \nstorage in a blood bank or diagnostic testing of blood samples is not excluded, whereas a \ntreatment of blood by dialysis with the blood being returned to the same body would be \nexcluded. \n \nRegarding methods which are carried out on or in relation to the living human or animal \nbody, it should be borne in mind that the intention of Section 21(3)(c) is only to free from \nrestraint non-commercial and non-industrial medical and veterinary activities. Interpretation \nof the provision should avoid the exclusions from going beyond their proper limits. \n\n\n \n59 \n \nHowever, in contrast to the subject-matter referred to in Art. 52(2) and (3) which is only \nexcluded from patentability if claimed as such, a method claim is not allowable under Section \n21(3)(c) if it includes at least one feature defining a physical activity or action that \nconstitutes a method step for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy \nor a diagnostic method step to be exercised on the human or animal body. In that case, \nwhether or not the claim includes or consists of features directed to a technical operation \nperformed on a technical object is legally irrelevant to the application of Section 21(3)(c). \n \nTaking the three exclusions in turn: \nSurgery defines the nature of the treatment rather than its purpose. Thus, for example, a \nmethod of treatment by surgery for cosmetic purposes or for embryo transfer is excluded, as \nwell as surgical treatment for therapeutic purposes. \n \nTherapy implies the curing of a disease or malfunction of the body and covers prophylactic \ntreatment, e.g. immunisation against a certain disease or the removal of plaque. A method \nfor therapeutic purposes concerning the functioning of an apparatus associated with a living \nhuman or animal body is not excluded if no functional relationship exists between the steps \nrelated to the apparatus and the therapeutic effect of the apparatus on the \nbody. \n \nDiagnostic methods likewise do not cover all methods related to diagnosis. Methods for \nobtaining information (data, physical quantities) from the living human or animal body are \nnot excluded by Section 21(3)(c), if the information obtained merely provides intermediate \nresults which, on their own, do not enable a decision to be made on the treatment \nnecessary.  \n \nGenerally such methods include X-ray investigations, NMR studies, and blood pressure \nmeasurements. \n6.34.2 Method of testing \nMethods of testing generally should be regarded as inventions industrially applicable and \ntherefore patentable if the test is applicable to the improvement or control of a product, \napparatus or process which is itself industrially applicable. In particular, the utilisation of test \nanimals for test purposes in industry, e.g. for testing industrial products (for example for \nascertaining the absence of pyrogenetic or allergic effects) or phenomena (for example for \ndetermining water or air pollution) would be patentable.  \n6.34.3 Industrial application vs. exclusion under Sec. 21(3) \nIt should be noted that \" industrial application\" is not a requirement that overrides the \nrestriction of Sec. 21(3), e.g. an administrative method of stock control is not patentable, \nhaving regard to Sec. 21(3)(c), even though it could be applied to the factory store-room for \nspare parts. On the other hand, although an invention must be \"industrially applicable\" and \nthe description must indicate, where this is not apparent, the way in which the invention is \nthus industrially applicable,  the claims need not necessarily be restricted to the industrial \napplication(s). \n6.35  \nMatters excluded from patentability \nSection 21(3) sets out a list of exclusions from patentability, namely: \n \n2l(3)(a) - \na discovery, scientific theory or mathematical method; \nNote. The fact that a known material has an unknown property is a discovery and as such is \nnot itself patentable, but an application or use of that material may be patentable eg in a \n\n\n \n60 \nparticular process. Similarly, finding a new substance or micro-organism occurring in nature \nis a discovery, but the process of isolating and extracting it, and the material so obtained, \ncould be patentable. \n \n21(3)(b) - \na scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act, playing a game or \ndoing business; \nWhat is the position in regard to patents on computer programs? \n \nNote: \n(i)  \nalthough rules for games cannot be patented (again they are covered by copyright), \napparatus for playing a particular game (eg comprising board, pieces and rules) may \nbe patentable  \n \n(ii)  \n\"methods of doing business\" is an exclusion of importance. Methods of book keeping, \ntrading stocks and shares etc are generally not patentable \n \n \n21(3)(c) -  \ndiagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans and \nanimals. \n \nNote: Another exclusion of major importance.  Pharmaceutical products are patentable, as \nare methods of making them. Equipment for use in medicine and surgery (eg scalpels, \noperating tables) is also patentable. \n \n21(3)(d) -  \nthe presentation of information  \nNote: This exclusion relates to simple non-technical devices such as credit card voucher or a \nbus ticket. A camera with a new way of presenting information in the viewfinder to assist the \nphotographer would however be patentable. \n \n21(3)(e) -  \npublic health related methods of use or uses of any molecule or other \nsubstance whatsoever used for the prevention or treatment of any disease which the \nminister responsible for matters relating to health may designate as a serious health hazard \nor as a life threatening disease. \nNote: This provision was included in the Industrial Property Act, 2001 following the \ndeclaration of AIDS as a national disaster by the President of the Republic of Kenya. \n \n26(a) - Plant varieties as provided for in the Seeds and Plant Varieties Act Cap 326 but not \nparts thereof or products of biotechnological processes, and \n \n26(b) - Inventions contrary to public order, morality, public health and safety, principles of \nhumanity and environmental conservation. \n \nProbably the most important exclusions, as indicated above, are business methods and \nmethods of medically treating humans and animals. It is particularly important to note that \nsuch methods may be patentable in some other countries, including the United States, so \nIPERs drawn up by USPTO and US equivalent patents should be checked carefully to ensure \nthat they do not cover claims to business methods or to diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical \nmethods for the treatment of humans or animals. \n \nEqually it important to note that sections 21(3) and 26 does not exclude computer \nprogrammes.  \n\n\n \n61 \n6.36  \nMatters prejudicial to public order, morality, safety and environment \nSection 26(b) excludes from patentability inventions of which the commercial exploitation \nwould be contrary to public order or morality, or prejudicial to humans, animals or plant life \nor health, or to the environment. What is excluded here will probably be decided by \ngovernment policy, for instance, land mines, mantraps and letter bombs might be excluded \nhere, or methods for cloning human beings. It is important for patent examiners to be aware \nof this section, although the occasions when this section is invoked are in practice likely to \nbe rare.  \n \n6.37  \nRecommendation to grant \nIf the examiner considers that the application satisfies the requirements of the Act and is \nthus in order to proceed to grant, he should make a brief written report on his findings. \nThese should be a summary of the search and examination report. \n6.38  \nRecommendation to refuse \nWhen making a report for an application which is not in order for grant of a patent, the \nexaminer should set out the points at issue, the case history to the extent necessary to \nenable a quick grasp of the essential facts, and recommend the action to be taken, e.g. \nrefusal, or grant conditional upon certain further amendments.  \n \nIf, on the other hand, the examiner is satisfied that the applicant has had sufficient \nopportunity to amend and that all the requirements are still not met, she should issue a \ndecision to refuse the application. The grounds of refusal must be stated and full reasons \nmust be given. \nRefusal may be based only on grounds on which the applicant has had an opportunity to put \nforward comments. In addition, the applicant's attention must be directed to the provisions \nfor appeal laid down in section 47. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n62 \nChapter VII: \nGrant and publication \n7.0 \nGrant of Patent \nIf the applicant has fulfilled the requirements of the Act, a patent is granted, provided that \nmaintenance, grant and publication fees have been paid. Every patent granted shall be \nregistered, and published in the Journal. A certificate of grant of a patent in Form IP 10 \nshould be issued and accompanied with a copy of the patent documents (abstract, disclosure \nand claims) as at the time of grant. \n \n7.1 \nRegisters of patent applications and grants \nThe register is kept as a permanent record of the summary particulars of the patent \napplications and grant. The summary particulars mainly comprise of bibiliographic. The \nrecord items to be entered in the register with respect to patent applications are laid down in \nRegulation 30(2) and should include: \na) The application number  \nb) The filing date; \nc) The name and address of the applicant; \nd) The title of the invention; \ne) The name and address of the inventor (except where inventor is not to be named as \nprovided under Section 33 of the Act); \nf) If priority is claimed, the priority date and the name of the state in which or for which \nthe earlier application was filed; \ng) The date of the request for an examination submitted under section 44(2) of the Act; \nh) The publication date of the application; \ni) The address for service of the applicant; \nj) A notice of every document effecting a change in ownership of the application or \npurporting to give the application or an interest in it as security; \nk) If the applicant dies, a notice of that fact; and \nl) Any other information required under the Act or these Regulations or that the \nManaging Director considers appropriate. \n \nFor granted patents the information above should be included and in addition:- \na) The number of the patent; \nb) The name and address of the owner of the patent; \nc) The date of the grant of the patent; \nd) The address for service of the owner; \ne) A notice of every document effecting a change in \nf) ownership of the patent or purporting to give the patent or an interest in it as \nsecurity: \ng) A notice of every document effecting a change in \nh) ownership of a licence or purporting to give a licence or an interest in it as security; \ni) If the owner of the patent dies, a notice of that \nj) fact; and \nk) Any other information required under the Act or the Regulations or that the Managing \nDirector considers appropriate. \n \nA person who wishes to obtain an extract from the patent register should make a request in \nForm IP 11 for a certified copy or in Form IP 12 for an uncertified copy. \n\n\n \n63 \n \nChapter VIII: \nRegional and International Applications \n8.0 \nIntroduction \nThe Institute acts as a receiving Office for regional applications under the Harare Protocol \nand for international applications filed under the Patent cooperation Treaty. Where the \nInstitute acts as a receiving Office the following documents must be filed in triplicate: -  \n• \nthe request,  \n• \nthe description,  \n• \nthe claims,  \n• \nthe abstract; and \n• \nthe drawings where applicable.  \n \nAn application for which the Institute is chosen by the applicant as the receiving Office must \nbe filed directly with the Institute.  \n \nThe initial processing and formal examination of international applications are carried out by \nthe receiving Office and the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization (WIPO) in accordance with the provisions of the PCT. When the Institute is \nacting as a receiving Office, the formality checks will be done in accordance with the PCT \nReceiving Office Guidelines. \n  \nWith regard to deadlines and procedural steps before the Institute as a receiving Office, \nexaminers should use the guidelines for receiving office issued by the WIPO. \n \n8.1 \nNational Phase \nWhere an applicant is desirous of obtaining a patent in respect of Kenya through the PCT \nroute, he must seek entry into the national phase by the 30th month from the international \nfiling date. Where priority is claimed entry into the national phase should be sought by the \n30th month from the priority date. \n \nTo enter the national phase the applicant should file the request on Form IP 13 and \naccompany with a copy of the patent application as published by the WIPO. During entry \ninto the national phase it is the duty of the applicant to do the following:-  \n \n• \nif the applicant is non resident, must be represented by a registered patent Agent \nwho should submit form IP 39 upon payment of the prescribed fee. \n• \nProvide a translation of the specification if the international application was not \npublished in English. \n• \nPay the application fee. \n• \nRequest for national processing of the application preferably by submitting a duly \ncompleted Form IP 13.  \n \nIf any amendments have been filed and they are not in English, then under Regulation 79 \nthe applicant should be invited to file the required translation within two months. Any \namendment which remains not translated should be ignored. \n \n8.2 \nSubstantive Examination of PCT Applications \nOrdinarily, PCT applications will be accompanied by the opinion of the international search \nexaminer and/or the IPEA’s examiner as to the presence of novelty, inventive step and \n\n\n \n64 \nindustrial applicability. Depending on the opinion of the IPER, applications will fall into one of \nthe following three categories, which will determine course of substantive examination:  \n \n(i)  \nPCT applications with a wholly favourable IPER \nIf the IPER is wholly favourable then the major requirements of section 44(3) can be taken \nas met. However the exclusions listed in sections 21(3) and 26 should be checked since \nmethods for treating people and animals, methods for doing business etc. cannot be \npatented in Kenya but may be patentable elsewhere. If there is an objection under sections \n21(3) and 26, a proposal to reject the application should be made stating the grounds of \nsuch refusal. \n \nWhere no objection under sections 21(3) and 26 a substantive examination report generated \nas well as an examiner’s internal recommendation to grant forwarded to the Managing \nDirector. \n \nUpon approval by the Managing Director, the grant and publication procedure outlined \nearlier with regard to national applications should apply apply. \n \n(ii)  \nPCT applications with an IPER which is favourable in respect of novelty, \ninventive step and industrial application but where other defects or observations \nare noted \n \n \n(iii)  \nPCT applications with an IPER which is unfavourable in respect of one or \nmore of novelty, inventive step and industrial application or with another major \nobjection outstanding; \nFor this case there are basically two possibilities: \n(a) \n the defects or observations are not at variance with the requirements of the Act or \nthe Regulations therefore no valid objections can be raised. For instance, PCT rule \n6.4(a) has provision different from the Act. In such cases, after checking the \nrequirements of sections 21(3) and 26, the procedure set out in the case where the \nexaminer internally recommends the application for grant above applies. \n \n(b)  \nthe defects or observations are such that it is clear what constitutes a valid response. \n \nALL OTHER APPLICATIONS, ie \n(III)  PCT application with an IPER which is unfavourable in respect of one or more of \nnovelty, inventive step and industrial application, or with another major objection \noutstanding. \n(VI)  \nPCT applications without an IPER;  \n \nThe applicant may be requested to provide, in respect of any application for a patent (or \nother title of protection) for the same invention: \n \n(1)  \nthe date and number of that application  \n(2)  \na copy of: \n(a)  \nany search or examination report,  \n(b)  \nthe patent (or other title),  \n(c) \n any final decision refusing the application, and  \n(d) \n any final decision invalidating the patent or other title. \n(3)  \na verified translation of any of the above if not in English \n \n\n\n \n65 \nSuch documents may be used only for facilitating the evaluation of the novelty and Inventive \nstep, ie such documents do not themselves provide the applicant with any rights in Kenya \nand the applicant too may be invited to comment on any of the documents he has furnished. \n \nIf a suitable equivalent patent i.e. one granted by an appropriate Industrial Property Office \n(or an equivalent application) has been noted by the applicant or found in the Patent \nRegistry, e.g. by an online search, then a response should be issued suggesting amendment \nin accordance with the foreign patent. If the application has not yet been granted, the letter \nshould be amended accordingly. The requirements of sections 21(3) and 26 should also be \nchecked. \n \nIf a suitable equivalent has not been found, then the applicant should be invited to submit \ndetails of equivalent patents (or patent applications).  \n \nIf Kenya is an elected Office then applicants cannot be required to furnish information or \ndocuments in respect of the same international application being examined in any other \nelected Office. The requirements of sections 21(3) and 26 should also be checked. Once a \nsuitable granted patent in English - or a verified translation thereof filed under Regulation 79 \n- has been received, then the procedure set out for substantive examination of national \napplications is applied. \n \n8.3 \nARIPO Patents Utility Models designs designating Kenya \n \nThe examiner shall carefully scrutinize all patents and utility models applications designating \nKenya with a view of ensuring that the provisions of the Act are fully complied with and that \nthe requisite communications under the said sections are sent to the ARIPO Secretariat \nwithin six months from the date of the notification by ARIPO. \n \n \nChapter IX: \nAnnual fees \nUnder section 61 in order to keep alive a patent application or a granted patent, an annual \nfee is annually due in advance by or before the anniversary of the filing date, starting one \nyear after the filing date. However, the fee is payable within a grace period of six months \nprovided that the applicant pays the prescribed surcharge. \n \nIf the application has not come through the PCT route, then the filing date will be that \ndetermined under section 41. If the application has come through the PCT route, then the \nfiling date will be the international filing date. \n \nFailure to pay annual or maintenance fee will result in the application or patent being \ndeemed to be withdrawn or lapsed. Under section 38(7)(d)(ii) the lapse of a patent is \nrequired to be entered in the register and published in Industrial Property Journal or in the \nGazette. \n \nIn the case of PCT applications, annual fees need not be paid until the application enters the \nnational phase. \n\n\n \n66 \n \nPART II: INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS \n1.0 \nIntroduction \nThese Guidelines are structured to follow the sequence of the examination process with each \nsection and sub-section constituting a step in the registration proceedings from the receipt of \nthe application up to registration and publication. The General Principles (see below) should \nbe kept in mind throughout the whole examination process.  \n2.0 \nGeneral Principles  \n2.1 \nRegistration  \nThe Industrial Property Act requires the creation and maintenance of a Register of designs in \nwhich the particulars of the registrations will be entered (Sec 45, Reg. 45).  \n2.3 \nScope of Examination  \nThe registration procedure involves examination of compliance with the requirements of the \nAct and the Regulations. However, there are three substantive grounds for refusing an \napplication:  \nwhere the subject-matter of the application does not correspond to the definition of a design \nas set forth in Sec. 84 ; or  \n• \nwhere the design is contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality. (Sec. \n86 (4)) \n• \nwhere the design is not new as required by Sec. 86 of the Act. \n(what about design copyright overlap?) \n \nWhere one of these three grounds is applicable, the examiner notifies the applicant \naccordingly in the examination report. The applicant will be given the opportunity of \nwithdrawing or amending (Reg. 50) the application or of submitting his/her observations \nbefore the examiner takes a decision. The meanings of “design” and “public policy or \naccepted principles of morality” are explained in section 5 below.  \n2.5 \nTime Limits (Reg. 76)  \nThe general rules for the calculation of time limits given in the Act, the Reg. (47(11) and \n24(2,3)) and the 2nd Schedule are specified in these Guidelines. If a request for extension of \na time limit is made before its expiry and reasons are given by the applicant, then a further \nperiod will be allowed. Additional extensions will be granted in exceptional cases only.  \n2.6 \nDecisions (Reg. 50)  \nIn all cases where an examiner takes a decision adverse to the applicant the grounds for the \ndecision must be given. Such decision is communicated via a standard letter, containing \nlanguage that will be adapted to each particular case, which refers to the relevant provisions \nof the Regulations and explains the reason(s) for the decision.  \n2.7 \nAppeal (Sec. 112, Reg. 74, 75)  \nApplicants have a right to appeal against any decision of the Managing Director to the \nIndustrial Property Tribunal.  \n\n\n \n67 \n \n2.8 \nReceipt of Application  \nDate of Receipt and File Number (Sec.87 )  \nThe application shall be presented by the applicant or agent to the Institute. The application \nwill then be assigned a file number and receiving date then captured in IPAS upon payment \nof the filing fees; after which the application will be transmitted to the patent registry for \nfurther processing. In each case the pages of the document making up the application are \nmarked with the date of receipt and the file number of the application.  \n2.9 \nAllocation of Filing Date  \nMinimum Requirements (Sec. 87(6))  \nIn order to allocate a filing date to an application for a registered design the examiner \nchecks whether the application contains at least:- \na) a request for registration of a design (IP. Form 27), and information identifying \nthe applicant, and  \nb) a graphic representation of the article embodying the industrial design or a \nspecimen.  (sec 87(2) –specific on specimen requirement) \nc) Application fees \nd) Identification of the Applicant (Sec. 87(7))  \n \nThe requirement under paragraph 4.1.(b) for according a filing date does not mean that the \ninformation identifying the applicant has to comprise all the details set out in paragraph \n11.1. It has to be clear from that information who the applicant is, i.e. natural persons have \nto indicate at least their family name and given names(s); legal entities need to state their \nusual designation.  \n2.10 Representation of the Design (Sec. 87(7))  \nSince the representation is the means to specify the features of the design for which \nprotection is sought, it is of utmost importance that it is clear and complete and that nothing \nregarding the design is left to conjecture.  \n \nDrawings, photographs (except slides), computer-made representations or any other \ngraphical representation are accepted provided they are suitable for reproduction.  \n \nFor the purpose of allocating a filing date, a representation is considered suitable for \nreproduction when it meets the requirement that the design must be reproduced on a \nneutral background and must not be retouched with ink or correcting fluid. It must be of a \nquality permitting all the details of the matter for which protection is sought to be clearly \ndistinguished and permitting it to be reduced or enlarged to a size not more than 8 cm by 16 \ncm per view for entry in the Register and for direct publishing in the Industrial Property \nJournal referred to in Sec. 91. A background is considered neutral as long as the design is \nclearly discernible on it. It is acceptable to present graphic representations in colour-e.g. \nphotographs mounted on paper. \n \nThe Institute accepts all representations of designs that meet the formal requirements of \nReg.15. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the representation of the \ndesign is of a quality allowing all the details for which protection is sought to be clearly \ndistinguished.  \n\n\n \n68 \n3.0 \nFiling date  \nThe first task for the examiner is to determine whether the application meets the \nrequirement for according the filing date. These requirements are prescribed under section \n87(6) as listed in paragraph above.  \n \nThe documents referred to above should be in English but do not have to meet any \nparticular requirements as to form or presentation. It is essential however they be \nsufficiently legible to enable the information to be discerned. The applicant should be \nconsidered sufficiently identified whenever it is possible to establish the identity of the \napplicant beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of all data contained in the documents filed. \nWhere there is more than one applicant each applicant must be similarly identified. No \nobjection should be raised at this stage with regard to the status of the applicant or his \nentitlement to apply.  \n \nIf the application does not fulfil these requirements the examiner is required to invite the \napplicant, within 14 days from the date of the examination, to submit the required \ncorrection. The invitation should indicate that the applicant has 60 days to comply. If the \napplicant does not comply with the invitation and, as a result, the examiner treats the \napplication as if it had not been filed, the examiner should, within fourteen days, inform the \napplicant in writing. \n \nWhere an application meets the aforementioned requirements, the receiving date becomes \nthe filing date and the same must be so communicated to the applicant in writing. \n4.0 \nFormal Requirements \n4.1 \nDetails of the applicant (Sec. 87) \nThe applicant must state his/her name, address, nationality and the State in which he/she is \ndomiciled or has his/her seat or establishment. Names of natural persons must be indicated \nby the person's family name and given name(s). In addition to their names, companies, \nfirms and other legal entities must indicate their form of incorporation, which may be \nabbreviated (e.g. Ltd., Inc., PLC, S.A.), and indicate the law of the State governing them.  \n \nThe names of legal entities should be given in full and only their form of incorporation may \nbe abbreviated. The address should contain, if possible, the street, street number, city or \ncounty, postal code and country. The applicant should indicate only one address, but if there \nare several, the first one mentioned will be recorded by the examiner as the address for \nservice, unless the applicant specifically designates another one as an address for service. \nThe telephone numbers as well as fax numbers and details of other data communication \nlinks, such as electronic mail, may be given by the applicant. \n4.2 \nCitation of Creator(s) (Sec. 85,33 )  \nThe application shall include a citation of the creator(s) or an indication that the creator(s) \nhas/have waived the right to be cited. The citation and the waiver or the absences of any \nindication regarding the creator(s) are not subject to examination. Where neither a creator is \ncited nor a waiver of the right to be cited is indicated, an objection will be raised by the \nexaminer. \n \nIn cases where the applicant is not the designer, a statement justifying the applicant’s right \nto the design-an assignment-shall also be filed.  \n\n\n \n69 \n4.4 \nFormat of the Representation of the Design (Reg. 47)  \nThe graphic representation of the design must consist of a graphic or photographic \nreproduction of a single design in black and white or in colour. It must fulfil the following \nrequirements:  \na) the representation must be filed on separate sheets of paper or reproduced on the page \nprovided in the form made available by the Institute;  \nb) in case of separate sheets of paper, the design must be reproduced on white and opaque \npaper either pasted or printed directly on it. Only one copy must be filed and the sheets \nof paper must not be folded or stapled;  \nc) the size of the separate sheet must be A4 size (29.7 cm high, 21 cm wide) and the space \nused for the reproduction must not be larger than 26.2 cm x 17 cm. A margin of at least \n2.5 cm must be left on the left-hand side; the sheets of paper must also indicate on the \ntop the number of views and, in case of a multiple application, the consecutive number \nof the design; they must not contain any explanatory text, wording or symbols other \nthan the indication or the name or address of the applicant;  \nd) the design must be reproduced on a neutral background and must not be retouched with \nink or correcting fluid. It must be of a quality permitting all the details of the matter for \nwhich protection is sought to be clearly distinguished and permitting it to be reduced or \nenlarged to a size not more than 8 cm by 16 cm per view for entry in the Register and \nfor direct publishing in the Journal. The Institute will accept colour representations. \nWhere the representation is in colour, the registration and the publication will also be in \ncolour.  \n \nIt is the applicant’s interest and responsibility to submit a suitable representation including a \nsufficient number of views to specify all the features of the design for which protection is \nsought.  The examiner will not check whether the design might have other features which \nare not shown in the views as submitted.  \n \nThe representation should include a sufficient number of different views of the design to \nenable the examiner conceptualize the features of the design for which protection is sought. \nWhere the examiner is of the opinion that the number of views presented is not sufficient, \nhe may ask for more. The views may be plain, elevation, section, or perspective views. Detail \nviews of portions of the design on an enlarged scale may be used as well. The alternate \npositions of a design, or of a feature of the design, must be shown in separate views. Each \nof the representations must be labelled by the applicant in to indicate the views they \nrepresent. Where more than one view is presented, and the applicant has not indicated \nwhich view should accompany the publication, the examiner should select one representative \nview for publication.  \n \nThe examiner should check whether the views relate to the same design. The representation \nof a design should be limited to the features for which protection is sought. \n \nHowever, the representations may comprise other elements that help to identify the features \nof a design for which protection is sought. In an application for registration of a design the \nfollowing identifiers will be allowed:-  \n \na. \nDotted lines may be used in a view either to indicate the elements for which no \nprotection is sought or to indicate portions of the design which are not visible in that \nparticular view, i.e. non-visible lines. Therefore, dotted lines identify elements which \nare not part of the view in which they are used.  \nb. \nBoundaries may be used to surround features of the design for which protection is \nsought.  \nc. \nColouring may be used on a black and white drawing to highlight the features of the \ndesign for which protection is sought only. Where the design concerns ornamentation, \n\n\n \n70 \na product to which it is applied may be identified by dotted lines or the ornamentation \nmay be surrounded by boundaries.  \n \nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to use the dotted lines, boundaries and colouring in such a \nway to make clear for which features protection is sought and for which not, since the \nexaminer will not conduct any examination other than verifying the suitability of the \nreproduction for publication.  \n4.5 \nRepetitive Patterns  \nWhere the registration of a design consisting in a repeating surface pattern is applied for, \nthe representation of the design must show the complete pattern and a sufficient portion of \nthe repeating surface.  \n4.6 \nTypographic Typefaces  \nWhere registration for a design consisting of a typographic typeface is applied for, the \nrepresentation of the design must consist of a representation of a string of all the letters of \nthe alphabet, upper case and lower case, and of all the Arabic numerals, as well as of a text \nof five lines produced with the typographic typefaces, all being in the size pitch 16.  \n4.7 \nSignature  \nThe application has to be signed by the applicant or his/her representative  \n4.8 \nTreating Deficiencies (Sec. 41(2, 3))  \nIf there is any deficiency regarding one of the above requirements, the examiner \nnotifies the applicant accordingly in the examination report. \n5.0 \nIndication of Products  \n5.1 \nClear Indication \nThe application must further contain an indication of the products in which the design is \nintended to be incorporated or to which it is intended to be applied. The applicant has to \nword the products in such a way as to indicate clearly the nature of the products and to \nallow each of them to be classified in only one class of the Locarno Classification. It should \nbe noted that the indication of products does not affect as such the scope of protection of a \ndesign.  \n \nThe examiner may invite the applicant to amend the wording used by the applicant in order \nto indicate a product with an equivalent term belonging to the Locarno Classification. \nStraightforward examples are synonyms American/English such as jewelry – jewellery, trunk \n– boot, sidewalk - pavement, nightshifts – nightshirts, garbage – rubbish etc. However, the \nexaminer should refrain from replacing the applicant’s wording with a more specific term.  \n5.2 \nPreferred Form  \nIn order to speed up and simplify the registration procedure, it is highly recommended that \napplicants indicate the products by using the terms listed in the Locarno Classification which \nis accessible on-line at www.wipo.int.  \n5.3 \nTreating Deficiencies  \nIn case the application does not contain an indication of products the examiner notifies the \napplicant of the deficiency in the examination report. \n\n\n \n71 \n6.0 \nTransmission of the application to ARIPO (Reg. 31) \nWhere the applicant chooses to file his/her application at the Institute the date of receipt of \nthe application by the Institute will become the date of filing, provided that the application \nmeets all the formal requirements under the Harare Protocol. The Institute will prepare and \ntransmit the application immediately the applicant pays the transmittal fee together with the \nactual cost of mailing. \n7.0 \nTreating Deficiencies  \nWhere a priority is claimed, the examiner should check whether:  \na) the file number of the earlier application is indicated;  \nb) the filing date of the application for a registered design falls within the period of six \nmonths of the claimed priority date;  \nc) the previous application(s) has/have been filed in or for a State on the Paris Convention \nlist or the WTO list;  \nd) the time limit to file a declaration of priority is complied with.  \n \nThe examiner will examine whether the subject-matter of the priority application and the \npresent application are the same. He will raise an objection only where a clear discrepancy is \nfound.  \n \nWhere a deficiency has been found, the examiner will invite the applicant to remedy the \ndeficiencies in the examination report. If the deficiencies cannot be remedied, the right of \npriority will be lost.  \n \nWhere the examiner finds that the applicant has lost a right to claim a priority, he/she \nnotifies the applicant accordingly.  \n8.0 \nExamination:  Grounds for Non- Registrability. \nThe examiner will refuse the application where he/she finds that the subject-matter of the \napplication does not correspond to the definition of a design as set forth in Sec. 84 ; or is not \nnovel as required by Sec. 86 , or  is contrary to public policy or to accepted principles or \nmorality.  \n8.1 \nDefinition of “design” (Sec. 84a).  \nAn “industrial design” means any composition of lines or colours or any three dimensional \nform, whether or not associated with lines or colours; Provided that such composition or \nform gives a special appearance to a product of industry or handicraft and can serve as a \npattern for a product of industry or handicraft. \n  \n \nA “product” means any industrial or handicraft item, including packaging, get-up, graphic \nsymbols or typographic typefaces, but excluding computer programs.  \n \nCompliance with the definition of a design is subject to examination. Failure to comply with \nthe definition constitutes a ground for non-registrability.  \n \nWhere the application concerns the design of a product composed of multiple components, \nthe representation of the design must include at least one view showing the product as a \nwhole, i.e. all components assembled, otherwise the representation is considered as \ncomprising multiple designs. A representation comprising multiple designs constitutes a \ndeficiency in the format of the representation (see paragraph 11.4).  \n \nWhere a representation comprises a set of articles, the representation will not be considered \nas representing a design in the meaning of Sec. 84 except where it is clear from the \n\n\n \n72 \nrepresentation that protection is sought for a design resulting from the combination of the \nfeatures of the articles. Such a combination may arise e.g. where the articles of the set are \nso closely related that they can be considered as forming a single product. For example, \nwhere forks, spoons and knives show common features, they will be considered as set of \narticles. At least one view has to show the set of articles together.  \n \nWhether the product indicated is actually made or used, or can be made or used, in an \nindustrial or handicraft manner, shall not be examined.  \n8.2 \nPublic Policy and Morality (Sec. 86(4))  \nThe examiner rejects an application if the design is contrary to public order or accepted \nprinciples of morality. There is no legal definition of “public order” and “morality” in the Act. \nAny refusal on that ground has to be reasoned by reference to the perception of the public \nwithin Kenya. By way of example, designs that contain racist messages or images are not \nacceptable. Poor taste manifested in a design is not a ground for non-registrability.  \n8.3 \nTreating Deficiencies (Sec. 87(7); Reg. 50)  \nWhere a ground for non-registrability is found, the examiner will notify the applicant in the \nexamination report along with other deficiencies, if any. A time limit of sixty days will be set \nfor the applicant to submit his/her observations, request for a hearing, withdraw the \napplication or amend it by submitting an amended representation of the design, provided \nthat the identity of the design is retained. The application will be rejected if the applicant \nfails to overcome the ground for non-registrability. \n9.0 \nClassification  \n9.1 \nPurpose (Sec. 87 (4))  \nThe examiner has to bear in mind that the classification of products serves exclusively \nadministrative purposes. It does not affect as such the scope of protection of a design.  \n9.2 \nLocarno Classification  \nThe most recent version of the Classification under the Locarno Agreement applies. The \nLocarno Agreement contains a List of Classes and an Alphabetical List giving a general \nindication of fields to which the products belong. The Alphabetical List should be consulted \nfor the classification of each specific product.  \n9.3 \nClassification by the Applicant \nThe applicant may submit with the application a classification of products indicating the \nclass(es) and sub-class(es) according to the Locarno Classification.  \n \nIf the applicant provides a classification, the products must be grouped according to the \nclasses of the Locarno Classification, each group being preceded by the number of the \nrelevant class and presented in the order of the classes and sub-classes.  \n \nThe applicant’s failure to submit a classification or failure to group or sort the products as \nrequired does not constitute a deficiency. The examiner is bound to confirm the applicant’s \nclassification or re-classify the application according to the current Locarno Classification. \n9.4 \nClassification by the Examiner  \nWhere the applicant has not submitted a classification, it will be produced by the examiner.  \n \nWhere the applicant has submitted a classification, but the classification being incorrect, the \nexaminer will substitute the classification of the applicant by his classification.  \n\n\n \n73 \n \nIf a product cannot be classified in accordance with the List of Classes or the Alphabetical \nList, the examiner may either request the applicant to specify the nature and purpose of the \ndesignated product, or classify the product in class 99 of the Locarno Classification (i.e. \n“Miscellaneous”) on condition that the product will be removed from this class as soon as a \nsuitable class is determined.  \n10.0 Multiple Design Applications \nTwo or more industrial designs may not be the subject of the same application (multiple \ndesign application). The Act has no provision for filing of multiple designs in a single \napplication. Such a filing constitutes a deficiency. \n11.0 Priority  \nPrevious Application(s) (Sec. 37)  \nPriority may be claimed on the basis of a previous (first) application of a design filed in or for \na State which is party to the Paris Convention or a member of the WTO. Priority can only be \nclaimed where the application for a design is filed within six months from the date of filing of \nthe first application(s).  \n \nWhere priority claim is declared for an application, the applicant must indicate the file \nnumber of the previous application(s) and file a copy thereof or the registration certificate \nissued by the competent authority shall be demanded by the Institute after three months \nfrom the date of making the declaration. Such a demand must be complied with within 90 \ndays from the date of invitation. \n12.0 Publication and opposition Period (Reg. 48 and 49)  \nFor all applications recommended for registration, the Managing Director shall publish a \nnotice of an application to register an industrial design in the Kenya Gazette or in the \nIndustrial Property Journal. Before the notice is published, the applicant shall pay the \npublication fee. Within 60 days after the notice of the application is published a person may \noppose the application by giving a notice of opposition in Form IP 23 in duplicate to the \nManaging Director.  \n \nThe notice of opposition shall set out the grounds for opposing the application. The \nManaging Director shall give one copy of the notice of opposition to the applicant. Within 42 \ndays after receiving the notice of opposition, the applicant shall give a counter-statement in \nForm IP 28 in duplicate to the Managing Director. The counter-statement shall set out the \ngrounds the applicant relies upon to support the application and shall set out any facts \nalleged in the notice of opposition that the applicant admits. \n \nThe Managing Director shall give one copy of the counter-statement to the person opposing \nthe application. Within 42 days after receiving the counter-statement, the person opposing \nthe application shall give to the Managing Director and to the applicant a statutory \ndeclaration or affidavit supporting the opposition to the application. \n \nWithin 42 days after receiving the statutory declaration or affidavit of the person opposing \nthe application, the applicant shall give to the Managing Director and to the person opposing \nthe application a statutory declaration or affidavit supporting the application. \n \nWithin one month after receiving the statutory declaration or affidavit of the applicant, the \nperson opposing the application may give to the Managing Director and to the applicant a \nstatutory declaration or affidavit replying to the applicant’s statutory declaration or affidavit. \n\n\n \n74 \nA statutory declaration or affidavit replying to the applicant’s statutory declaration or affidavit \nshall be confined to matters strictly in reply. If the applicant fails to provide a counter-\nstatement or a statutory declaration or affidavit, the application shall be deemed to have \nbeen withdrawn. \n \nIf the person opposing the application fails to provide a statutory declaration or affidavit, the \nopposition to the application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. \n \nAfter all documents have been provided the Managing Director shall conduct a hearing of the \nmatter. The Managing Director shall give at least 14 days notice of the hearing to each \nparty. A party may be heard at the hearing only if the party provides the Managing Director \nwith a notice in Form IP 29 at least seven days before the date of the hearing.

\nPREAMBLE \n \n \nWe, the Contracting States of this Protocol: \n \nHaving regard to the Agreement on the Creation of the African Regional Intellectual \nProperty Organization (ARIPO), concluded in LUSAKA, Zambia on December 9, 1976; \n \nIn accordance with the objectives of ARIPO generally and in particular Article III(c), \nwhich provides for the establishment of such common services or organs as may be \nnecessary or desirable for the co-ordination, harmonisation and development of the \nintellectual property activities affecting the members of ARIPO;  and \n \nConsidering the advantages of pooling resources in respect of industrial property \nadministration: \n \nHereby establish this Protocol to be known as the Banjul Protocol on Marks within the \nframework of the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and \nagree as follows:- \n \nSECTION 1 \n \nGENERAL \n \n1:1 \nThe African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) is hereby  \nentrusted with the registration of marks and the administration of such registered \nmarks on behalf of the Contracting States in accordance with the provisions of \nthis Protocol. \n \n1:2 \nIn the exercise of its functions under this Protocol, ARIPO shall act through its \nSecretariat, hereinafter referred to as “the Office”. \n \n \nSECTION 2 \n \nFILING OF APPLICATIONS \n \n2:1 \nAll applications for the registration of a mark shall be filed either directly with  \nthe Office or with the Industrial Property Office of a Contracting State by the \napplicant or his duly authorized representative. \n \n2:2 \nWhere: \n \n \n(a) \nan application is filed directly with ARIPO but the applicant’s principal  \nplace of business or ordinary residence is not in the host country of \nARIPO; or \n \n \n(b) \nan application is filed with the Industrial Property Office of a  \n\n\n \n5\nContracting State by an applicant whose principal place of business or \nordinary residence is not in a Contracting State; \n \n \nthe applicant shall be represented. \n \n2:3 \nRepresentation shall be by a patent or trade mark agent or by a legal \npractitioner who has a right to represent applicants before the Industrial \nProperty Office of any of the Contracting States. \n \n2:4 \nWhere an application is filed with the Industrial Property Office of a \nContracting State, such office shall, within one month of receiving the \napplication, transmit the application to the Office. \n \n \nSECTION 3 \n \nCONTENTS OF APPLICATION \n \n3:1 \nAn application for the registration of a mark shall identify the applicant and \n \ndesignate the Contracting States in which registration is being requested. \n \n3:2 \nThe application shall indicate the goods and/or services in respect of which  \nprotection of a mark is claimed, including the corresponding class or classes \nprovided for under the Nice Agreement Concerning the International \nClassification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of \nMarks of June 15, 1957 as revised.  For this purpose the ARIPO Office will \ncheck that the applicant has made such indication of class or classes and that \nindication is correct and where the applicant does not give such indication or the \nindication is not correct, the ARIPO Office shall classify the goods or services \nunder the appropriate class or classes of the Nice Agreement on payment of a \nclassification fee. \n \n3:3 \nWhere colour is claimed to be a distinctive feature of the mark, the applicant  \nshall make a statement to that effect as well as the name or names of the colour \nor colours claimed and an indication, in respect of each colour, of the principal \nparts of the mark which are in that colour. \n \n3:4 \nWhere the mark is a three-dimensional mark, the applicant shall make a  \nstatement to that effect and attach to the application a reproduction of the mark \nconsisting of a two-dimensional graphic or photographic reproduction either of a \nsingle view of the mark or several different views of the mark. \n \n3:5 \nThe application shall contain a declaration of actual use of the mark or \nintention to use the mark, or be accompanied by an application for the \nregistration of a person as a registered user of the mark; \n \n \n \n\n\n \n6\nProvided that where there is an application for a registered user the Director \nGeneral of the Office is satisfied that - \n \n(i) \nthe applicant intends it to be used by that person in relation to \nthose goods or services;  and  \n \n(ii) \nthat person shall be registered as a registered user thereof \nimmediately after registration of the mark. \n \n \nSECTION 3bis \n \nFILING DATE \n \n \nThe Office shall accord as the filing date of an application the date on which the \nfollowing indications or elements were received by the Contracting State in \nwhich the application was filed or were received by the Office: \n \n \n(i) \nan express or implied indication that registration of a mark is sought; \n \n \n(ii) \nan indication allowing the identity of the applicant to be established; \n \n(iii) \nindications sufficient to contact the applicant or his representative, if any, \nby mail; \n \n \n(iv) \na clear reproduction of the mark; \n \n \n(v) \na list of goods and/or services for which the registration is sought; \n \nprovided that the Office may accord as the filing date of the application the date \non which it received only some of the indications or elements referred to. \n \n \nSECTION 4 \n \nRIGHT OF PRIORITY \n \n4:1 \nAn applicant shall have the right to claim priority rights provided under Article 4 \nof the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 20th March, \n1883 as revised. \n \n4:2 \nThe right to priority shall only subsist when the application is made within six  \nmonths from the date of the earlier application. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n7\n \n \nSECTION 5 \n \nFORMALITIES EXAMINATION AND NOTIFICATION \n \n5:1 \nThe Office shall examine whether the formal requirements provided under \n \nSection 3 have been complied with and shall accord the appropriate filing \n \ndate to the application. \n \n5:2 \nIf the Office is of the opinion that the application does not comply with the \n \nformal requirements, it shall notify the applicant accordingly, inviting him to \n \ncomply with the requirements within a prescribed period.  If the applicant \n \ndoes not comply with the requirements within the said period, the Office \n \nshall refuse the application. \n \n5:3 \nIf the application complies with all the formal requirements, the Office shall  \nwithin the prescribed period, notify each designated State. \n \n5:4 \nWhere the Office refuses an application or a reconsideration in terms of \nSection 5bis: 1 is refused or an appeal in terms of Section 5bis: 2 is \nunsuccessful, the applicant may within a period of three months from the date \non which he receives notification of such refusal or result of appeal, request \nthat his application be treated, in any designated state, as an application \naccording to the national laws of that State. \n \n \nSECTION 5bis \n \nAPPEALS \n \n \n5bis. 1 Where under Section 5:4 of the Protocol the Office refuses any application, the \napplicant may, within the prescribed period, request the Office to reconsider \nthe matter. \n \n5bis.2 If after the Office has reconsidered the application, the Office  still refuses  the  \napplication, the applicant may lodge an appeal against the decision of the \nOffice to the Board of  Appeal established in terms of  Section 4bis of the \nProtocol on Patents and Industrial Designs Within the Framework of the \nAfrican Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO)(the Harare \nProtocol). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n8\n \nSECTION 6 \n \nSUBSTANTIVE EXAMINATION BY A DESIGNATED STATE \n \n6:1 \nEvery application for the registration of a mark shall be examined in \n \naccordance with the national laws of a designated state. \n \n6:2 \nBefore the expiration of twelve months from the date of the notification \nreferred to in Section 5:3, each designated state may make a written \ncommunication to the Office that, if a mark is registered by the Office, that \nregistration shall have no effect on its territory on the basis of any grounds, \nboth absolute and relative, including the existence of third party rights.  \n \n6:3 \nWhere the designated state refuses the application under Section 6:2, it shall \ngive reasons under its national laws for refusing the application.  These \nreasons shall within one month of the decision being made be communicated \nto the Office which shall without delay communicate the same to the \napplicant. \n \n6:4 \nThe applicant shall be given an opportunity to respond, directly to the \ndesignated state concerned, to the decision to refuse the application. The \ndecision shall be subject to appeal or review under the national laws of the \ndesignated state concerned. \n \n6:5 \nA communication to the Office under Section 6:2 or a refusal by a designated \nstate shall not prejudice the issuance by the Office of a certificate of \nregistration having effect in those designated states in respect of which the \napplication has not been subject to a communication under Section 6:2 or has \nnot been refused. \n \n6:6 \nWhere a designated state which makes a communication under Section 6:2 \nsubsequently withdraws it or where the designated state initially refused the \napplication but subsequently accepts the same, the designated state shall \nwithin one month communicate this fact to the Office.  In this case, the Office \nshall extend the registration to such designated state. \n \n \nSECTION 6bis \n \nPUBLICATION AND REGISTRATION OF A MARK BY THE OFFICE \n \n6bis.1 An application for registration of a Mark which has been accepted by any \ndesignated state or in respect of which any designated state has not made the \ncommunication referred to in Section 6:2 shall be published in the Marks \nJournal as having been accepted by the designated state or designated states \n concerned. \n \n\n\n \n9\n6bis:2 Subject to the provisions of Section 6bis.4, three months after the publication of \nthe journal referred to in Section 6bis.1, the Office shall register the mark on \npayment of registration fees.  Such registration shall be recorded in the Marks \nRegister and the Office shall issue to the applicant a certificate of registration. \n \n6bis.3 The fact of registration of a mark shall be published in the Journal. \n \n6bis: 4 At any time after the publication in the Marks Journal of an application as \naccepted by the designated state or designated states in terms of Section 6bis:1 \nbut before the registration of the mark in terms of Section 6bis: 2, any person \nmay give a notice of opposition to the application for registration in a \ndesignated state or designated states.  Thereafter, the application shall be \ntreated according to the opposition procedures laid down under the national \nlaws of the designated state or designated states concerned. \n \n \nSECTION 7 \n \nDURATION AND RENEWAL OF REGISTRATION \n \n \n7:1 \nThe registration of a mark shall be for a period of ten years from the filing \n \ndate. \n \n7:2 \nThe registration of a mark may be renewed for further periods of 10 years  on \n \npayment of the prescribed renewal fee. \n \n7:3 \nThe renewal of the registration shall be effected on or before the date of \n \nexpiration of the original registration or of  the \nlast \nrenewal \nof \nthe \n \nregistration provided that a grace period of six months shall be allowed, in \n \neither case, on payment of a surcharge. \n \n7:4 \nThe registration of a mark which has not been renewed because of non-\n \npayment of renewal fees within the period stipulated in Section 7:3  shall be \n \ndeemed to have lapsed and shall be removed from the Register. \n \n7:5 \nA mark removed from the register for non-payment of renewal fees may be \n \nrestored at the request of the owner on payment of the prescribed restoration \n \nfee within the prescribed period . \n \n \nSECTION 8 \n \nEFFECT OF REGISTRATION \n \n8:1 \nThe registration of a mark by the Office shall have the same effect in each  \ndesignated state, with respect to rights conferred by the mark, as if it was filed \nand registered under the national law of each such state. \n \n\n\n \n10\n8:2 \nThe national laws of each Contracting State shall apply to the cancellation of a \nregistration, whether based on non-use or any other grounds.  Where \nregistration has been cancelled, the Contracting State concerned shall, within \none month of cancellation, notify the Office.  The Office shall publish this fact \nin the Marks Journal and record it in the Register. \n \n8.3. \nThe indication of classes of goods or services provided for shall not bind the \nContracting States with regard to the determination of the scope of protection of \nthe mark. \n \n \nSECTION 9 \n \nLATER DESIGNATIONS \n \n9:1 \nWhere a mark has been registered by the Office or is pending registration in the \nOffice, the owner or applicant or, where applicable, his successor in title, shall \nhave the right to designate any other State which becomes a party to this \nProtocol subsequent to the registration or filing of the application for registration \nof the mark. \n \n9:2 \nWhere, under Section 9:1, the owner of a registered mark or applicant for  \nregistration of a mark designates any other state which becomes a party to this \nProtocol, such later designation shall be deemed to be an application for the \nregistration of a mark with respect to the state so designated and shall \naccordingly be subject to examination under the national law of such \ndesignated state as provided for under Section 6 of the Protocol.  In such  a \ncase,  the filing date of the application in the state so designated shall be the \ndate on which the application for later designation  is received.  \n \n \nSECTION 10 \n \nREGULATIONS \n \n10:1 \nThe Administrative Council shall make Regulations for the implementation of  \nthis Protocol and may amend them, as necessary. \n \n10:2 \nWithout derogating from the generality of subsection 10:1 the Regulations \nshall:- \n \n(i) \nstipulate any administrative requirements or any details necessary for the \nimplementation of the provisions of this Protocol and any relevant \ninternational treaties;

Applications \n\n\n                                \n \n22\n \n(1). The description of an invention in an application for a patent which requires for its \nperformance the use of a micro-organism \n(a)  which is not available to the public at the date of filing the application; and \n(b)  which cannot be described in the application in such a manner as to enable the \ninvention to be performed by a person skilled in the art shall be regarded as \ndisclosing the invention only if \n(i).  \nnot later than the date of filing of the application, a culture of the micro-\norganism has been deposited with an international depositary institution; \nand \n(ii).  \nthe name of the depositary institution, the date when the culture was \ndeposited and file number of the deposit are given  in the application, and, \nwhere a new deposit is made under paragraph 6 bis.4 below, the applicant \nor proprietor makes a new deposit in accordance with that paragraph. \n \n(2). Where the information specified under subparagraph (1) (b) (ii) above is not contained in \nthe application as filed, it shall be submitted to the ARIPO Office, \n(a)  before the end of the period of 16 months after the date of filing of the application \nor, if priority is claimed,  after the priority date. \n(b)  where the Office has received a request by any person for information and \ninspection of the application under Rule 3 of these Regulations, before the end of \none month after the Office communicates to the applicant a notification of receipt of \nthe request, whichever period is the earliest. \n \n(3). The submission of information specified in subparagraph (1)(b) (ii) above shall constitute \nthe unreserved and irrevocable consent of the applicant to the depositary institution with which a \nculture is from time to time deposited making the culture available on receipt of the certificate of \nthe ARIPO Office authorizing the release to the person named therein as a person to whom the \nculture may be made available and who makes a valid request to depositary institution. \n \n(4). The application for a patent referred to in subparagraph (1) above shall mention any \ninternational agreement under which the micro-organism concerned is deposited. \n \n \n6bis. 2. Availability of Culture \n \n(1). The deposited culture shall be available upon request to any person from the date of \npublication of the ARIPO patent application and to any person having the right to inspect the files \nunder Rule 3 prior to that date.  Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (3) of  Rule 6bis. 3 \nbelow, such availability shall be effected by the issue of a sample of the micro-organism to the \n\n\n                                \n \n23\nperson making the request (hereafter called “the requester”) and the said issue shall be made only if \nthe requester has undertaken vis-à-vis the applicant or the proprietor of the patent: \n(a).  not to make the deposited culture or any culture derived therefrom available to any \nthird party before the application has been refused or withdrawn or is deemed to be \nwithdrawn or, if a patent is granted, before the expiry of the patent; \n(b).  to use the deposited culture or any culture derived therefrom for experimental \npurposes only, until such time as the patent application is refused or withdrawn or is \ndeemed to be withdrawn or on the publication of the grant of the patent.  This \nprovision shall not apply where the requester is using the culture under a compulsory \nlicence. \n \n(2). For the purposes of subparagraph (1) above, a derived culture is deemed to be any culture \nof the micro-organism which still exhibits those characteristics of the deposited culture which are \nessential to the carrying out of the invention. The undertaking referred to in subparagraph (1) shall \nnot impede a deposit of a derived culture which is necessary for the purpose of patent procedure. \n \n(3). The request provided for in paragraph (1) shall be made to the ARIPO Office on a form \nrecognised by the ARIPO Office.  The ARIPO Office shall certify on the said form that an ARIPO \npatent application referring to the deposit of the micro-organism has been filed and that the \nrequester or the expert nominated by him is entitled to the issue of a sample of the micro-organism. \n \n(4). The ARIPO Office shall transmit the request, together with the certification provided for \nin subparagraph (3) above, to the depositary institution as well as to the applicant or the proprietor \nof the patent. \n \n(5). The Director General of the ARIPO Office shall publish in the Journal the list of \ndepositary institutions recognised for the purposes of this Rule. \n6bis. 3. Availability of Culture to Experts \n(1). Until the date of publication of the application, the applicant may inform the ARIPO \nOffice that until the grant of the patent or until the date on which the application has been refused or \nwithdrawn or is deemed to be withdrawn, the availability of the culture referred to in Rule 6bis.2 \nshall be effected only by the issue of a sample to an expert nominated by the requester. \n \n(2). The following may be nominated as an expert:  \n(a)  any natural person provided that the requester furnishes evidence at the time of \nfiling the request that the nomination has the approval of the applicant; \n(b)  any natural person recognised as an expert by the Director General of the ARIPO \nOffice. \n \n\n\n                                \n \n24\n(3). The nomination shall be accompanied by an undertaking from the expert vis-à-vis the \napplicant similar to that specified in Rule 6bis.2 (1).  In this instance the requester will be regarded \nas a third party. \n6bis. 4. New deposit of a micro-organism \n(1). If a micro-organism deposited in accordance with Rule 6bis.1 ceases to be available from \nthe institution with which it was deposited because: \n(a)  the micro-organism is no longer viable, or \n(b)  for any other reason the depositary institution  is unable to supply samples, and if the \nmicro-organism has not been transferred to another depositary institution recognised \nfor the purposes of Rule 6bis from which it continues to be available, an interruption \nin availability shall be deemed not to have occurred if a new deposit of the micro-\norganism originally deposited is made within a period of three months from the date \non which the depositor was notified of the interruption by the depositary institution \nand if a copy of the receipt of the deposit issued by the institution is forwarded to the \nARIPO Office within four months from the date of the new deposit stating the \nnumber of the application or the ARIPO patent. \n \n(2). In the case provided for in subparagraph (1) (a) above, the new deposit shall be made with \nthe depositary institution with which the original deposit was made; in the cases provided for in \nsubparagraph (1) (b) above, it may be made with another depositary institution recognised for the \npurposes Rule 6bis. \n \n(3). Where the institution with which the original deposit was made ceases to be recognised \nfor the purposes of the application of Rule 6bis, either entirely or for the kind of micro-organisms to \nwhich the deposited micro-organism belongs, or where that institution discontinues, temporarily or \ndefinitively, the performance of its functions as regards deposited micro-organisms, and the \nnotification referred to in subparagraph (1) from the depositary institution is not received within six \nmonths from the date of such event, the three months period referred to in subparagraph (1)  shall \nbegin on the date on which this event is announced in the Journal of the ARIPO Office. \n \n(4). Any new deposit shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the depositor alleging \nthat the newly deposited micro-organism is the same as that originally deposited. \n \n \nRule 7 \nContents of the Claims \n \n(1) The claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought in terms of the technical \nfeatures of the invention.  They shall be clear and concise and be supported by the description.

When it is done successfully, it \ndelivers a larger market share, increased revenue, greater future profits and business \ngrowth. \nManaging IP commercialization successfully depends on several internal and external \nfactors such as business objectives, type of IP as well as economic and technical \nresources accessible to the enterprise. It also depends on prevailing economic \nconditions at the time of commercialization.   \nIn addition, since IP can be commercialized either directly by its owner, or by building \nup business partnerships, the selection of the most appropriate tool is often \nchallenging, especially for Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs). \nRegardless of the sector, businesses generate and sell intangible assets. How to \ncommercialize, whether by the enterprise itself or not, is a matter of business strategy. \nThis guide has been prepared to provide information to IP rights owners on the various \nways they can follow to commercialize their intangible assets. The guide is based on \nfacts and best practices in IP rights commercialization globally.  \n \n1.1.1 \nConditions for use \nThis guide is aimed at providing information to the public and does not set aside the \nskills and advice of a legal professional or IP rights expert or any other professional \nadvice that may be required in the process of IP commercialization.  \n2.0 \nPathways to Commercialization  \nIP commercialization can be done by its owner, or through an assignment or by creation \nof partnerships, which takes many forms as illustrated in Figure 1. IP issues may also \narise in the ordinary course of doing business meaning that they may not lead to a \n\n\n[2] \n \nspecial commercialization contract. This guide details the conditions under which these \npathways can be pursued.  \n \nFigure 1: Pathways to commercialization, Adapted from European Union IP help desk, \n2016.  \n2.1.1 \nIP Commercialization by its Owner \nEnterprises may want to take up commercialization activities on their own when the \nbusiness: \ni. \nAlready has enough capabilities for marketing, so that there is no need for \npartnership, \nii. \nDoes not have enough capacities for building up and/or carrying out such a \npartnership, \nIP elements in usual commercial contracts  \n\n\n[3] \n \niii. \nHesitates to share information with third parties, or does not want to create \npossible competitors or spend money and make an effort to building \npartnerships. \nThis first section covers the most essential points, which should be taken into account \nby businesses during the different stages of the product development cycle, particularly \nwhen they prefer to commercialize their IP on their own. \n2.1.1.1 What to consider when commercialization of IP is carried out by its owner \na. Keep your ideas secret \nOnly inventions or designs not publicly disclosed can be protected as patents/utility \nmodels or designs. Moreover, IP rights in Kenya are registered on a first-to-file basis. \nTherefore, it is essential to keep your ideas secret in order to get the most benefit from \nthe advantages of IP protection. \nMeasures that may help businesses to keep their IP secret within the enterprise: \ni. \nMaking sure that employees, researchers and collaborators have in place \nconfidentiality obligations and reminding them from time to time of the \nimportance of complying with those obligations, \nii. \nReviewing  public  disclosures  (such  as  technical  publications  or  \ncommunications  with  potential  partners)  to  guarantee  that confidential \ninformation is not included therein, \niii. \nConfidential agreements with partners and testers are signed prior to performing \nconcept and technical testing. \nb. Conduct of search \nPerforming a search is an important step to verify whether the idea is new and worth \nbeing pursued. Besides, it also helps enterprises to avoid re-inventing and re-developing \nas well as applying for IP rights for an already existing technology, design or brand. \nc. Maintain  the records \n\n\n[4] \n \nKeeping records of inventions is of utmost importance, as this will help you to prove \nthe date and ownership of the invention, when needed. Besides, such records are a \nvaluable source of information when drafting patent applications. \nd. Protect IP \nTaking steps to protect your intangible assets is not only necessary for their proper \nmanagement, but also for getting full benefit from those assets. \nWhen considering IP protection, it must be noted that IP assets can be protected by \nseveral types of IP tools, and consequently the most appropriate protection strategy \nmust be chosen pertinent to the marketing strategy. \nFor example, inventions can be protected through patents and utility models, or by \nkeeping them in secret. You should, therefore, consult an IP professional on the most \nadequate registration strategy according to your product, business plan and budget. \ne. Enforce IP rights \nIP rights require constant monitoring, which is the responsibility of the owner. Hence, \nit is best practice to monitor the market and competitors to be sure of identifying any \ninfringing actions. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms may be utilized as \ntime and cost efficient measures to solve IP related disputes out of court (section 101 \nof the IP Act, 2001). \n2.1.2 \nAssignment of IP rights \nAn IP assignment is a transfer of ownership of an IP right, such as a patent, trade mark \nor design, from one party (the assignor) to another party (the assignee). Consequently, \nthe assignee becomes the new owner of the IP (Section 93 of the IP Act, 2001). \nAssignments are useful tools for commercialisation, when the owner of the IP does not \nhave enough capabilities (financial, human resource, marketing, etc.) to market the \ndeveloped intellectual asset and/or when the owner would like to realise an immediate \ncash flow from an IP asset, which he does not plan to exploit with its own resources. \n\n\n[5] \n \n2.1.2.1 What to consider in assignment of IP rights \na. Remember to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) \nBy its very nature, an assignment process involves detailed negotiations and requires \nexclusive information to be shared between the parties, even though the process does \nnot lead to an agreement in the end. Therefore, Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are \nimportant tools to guarantee that any shared confidential information will not be \ndisclosed or used for purposes other than the negotiation. \nNDAs are highly relevant for assignors in particular to protect their sensitive information \nat the pre-agreement stages, as assignees most probably need access to confidential \ninformation during due diligence activities and the negotiation phase. \nb. Analyse the risks by performing IP due diligence \nIn general terms, IP due diligence is a risk management tool revealing the value of the \nIP assets and liabilities. This exercise can also be used to gather as much information \nas possible on the IP being assigned. Due diligence studies are performed by \nmultidisciplinary teams of IP experts from legal, financial and technology areas and \ngenerally clarify the following about the IP asset to be assigned: \ni. \nthe ownership status \nii. \nthe status of the IP protection \niii. \nany restrictions on exploitation (freedom to operate) \niv. \nthe value of the IP, to be used as a basis during the negotiations \nv. \nlegal requirements for the assignment \nc. Key terms to consider in the assignment of the IP rights agreement \nAlthough assignment agreements need to be prepared with the assistance of lawyers \nand IP professionals, it is always best to know the most relevant issues as well as the \nkey IP clauses to be negotiated and included, before signing the agreement: \ni. \nThe form of the agreement: to be done in writing. \n\n\n[6] \n \nii. \nIdentification of the IP: the assigned IP must be clearly identified and the \ncorresponding know-how required for exploitation. \niii. \nThe payment: the amount, type (lump sum or in instalments) and terms of \npayment must be defined. \niv. \nWarranties: contractual assurances undertaken by both parties concerning \nspecific facts must be introduced. \nv. \nGoverning law and settlement of disputes: parties must agree on the law to be \napplied in case of any possible conflicts. Parties should also define how disputes \nare settled (directly in courts or via ADR mechanisms) (section 101 of the IP Act, \n2001). \nvi. \nRegister the assignee at the IP office to record the new owner in the IP \nregistries, as required by law (section 93 of the IP Act, 2001). \n2.1.3 \nLicensing and Franchising \n2.1.3.1 Licensing \nA license  is  a  contract  under  which  the  holder  of  an  intellectual property (licensor) \ngrants permission for the use of its intellectual property to another person (licensee), \nwithin the limits set by the provisions of the contract. Hence, in business language, a \nlicense allows  the  licensor  to  make  money  from  its  intellectual  asset  by charging \nthe licensee in return for its use. Licensing has a vital role in an enterprise’s \ncommercialization strategies, since there are significant advantages of licensing IP, \ncreating a win-win situation for both parties. \nBesides, license agreements can also be seen as instruments for the distribution of risks \nbetween the licensor and the licensee. \n2.1.3.2 Categorization of licenses \nThe type(s) of license(s) should be defined according to: \ni. \nThe business goals of the licensor \nii. \nThe products/services to be licensed \n\n\n[7] \n \niii. \nThe target market conditions (geographic and product segment) \niv. \nThe capabilities of the licensee \n2.1.3.3 Types of licenses \ni. \nExclusive: only the licensee is able to use the licensed IP or technology (the \nlicensor cannot use or license it); \nii. \nSole: the licensor agrees not to grant any additional licenses but retains the right \nto make use of the licensed IP. \niii. \nNon-Exclusive License: the licensee and the licensor can both use the licensed \nintellectual property or technology. The licensor is also allowed to negotiate \nfurther non-exclusive licenses with other enterprises.  \n2.1.3.4 Conditions for licensing  \ni. \nNegotiations: Be prepared for the negotiations and negotiate tactfully - licensing \nagreements are usually long term business partnerships. It is therefore common \nthat before entering into such an agreement, carrying out a due diligence audit \nand signing preparatory agreements, such as NDAs or Material Transfer \nAgreements (MTAs) help both parties mitigate the risks during the negotiations \nand towards the licensing period. The agreement should include a clause on the \nresponsibility (generally the licensee’s) for registration of the license agreement \nand payment of the relevant fees. \nii. \nGranted rights: the rights granted with the licensing agreement must be defined \nclearly. The licensee must carefully assess whether the rights included are \nsufficient for an optimal exploitation. \niii. \nImprovements: In patent licensing both parties can make improvements through \nfurther research or by developing know-how related to the licensed technology. \nTherefore, it is highly recommended for the parties to clearly address the \ntreatment of future improvements. The common practice is to grant mirror \n\n\n[8] \n \nrights, that is, each party retains ownership but grants rights on its own \nimprovements to the other. \niv. \nThe payment: the amount, type and terms of payment together with the \ncalculation of royalties (if applied) must be defined. Royalties may be calculated \non the basis of a percentage of the sale price, profits made or a fixed amount \nper each product unit sold etc. If deductions are to be made (e.g. tax, delivery \nexpenses) it is essential to clearly indicate them. The licensor can also define a \n“minimum amount of royalty” irrespective of the revenues generated by \nlicensor. \nv. \nWarranties: contractual assurances undertaken by both parties concerning \nspecific facts must be stated. \nvi. \nInfringement acts: parties should agree on how possible infringement acts \nagainst the licensed IP will be handled. \nvii. \nGoverning law and settlement of disputes: parties must agree on the law to be \napplied in case of any possible conflicts. Parties should also define how disputes \nare settled (directly in courts or via ADR mechanisms). \nviii. \nRegistration of the contract: registration of the licensing contract at the IP \noffice is necessary. \n2.1.3.5 Key terms in the licensing agreement \nAlthough licensing agreements need to be prepared with the assistance of lawyers and \nIP professionals, it is always best to be aware of the most relevant issues as well as the \nkey IP clauses to be negotiated and included, before signing the agreement: \ni. \nThe form of the agreement: written form is often necessary. \nii. \nThe duration of the agreement: the commencement, duration and termination \nof the contract must be clearly stated in the agreement. \niii. \nWhen defining the duration, the expiration date, the market and the economic \nlife of the IP to be licensed must be taken into account. \n\n\n[9] \n \niv. \nIdentification of the IP: the assigned IP must be clearly identified and the \ncorresponding know-how required for exploitation. \nv. \nThe type of licensing: exclusivity or non-exclusivity must be clearly stated. \nvi. \nGeographical scope and field of use: the geographical scope of the license (i.e. \nwhere the licensee can exploit the IP), should be clearly defined. In addition, \nthe licensor can limit the field of use of the licensed IP rights as well as the goods \nand services for which the license is granted. \nProhibited terms in licence contracts \nAccording to the Section 69 of the Industrial property Act No. 3 of 2001, clauses in a \nlicence contract should not imposes unjustified restrictions on the licensee with the \nconsequence that the contract, or should harmful to the economic interests of Kenya \notherwise the licence contract will not be registered by the Institute.   \n \n2.1.3.6 Franchising \nFranchising is a special type of licensing, enabling the replication of the owner’s \n(franchisor) business concept in another location by providing continuous support and \ntraining to the recipient (franchisee). Since business concepts include the use of IP \nallowing the business to be run, franchising has an intrinsic connection with IP based \non licensing of IPs and know-how. Franchising is a win-win deal: While on the one hand, \nfranchising helps franchisors to expand their business with the need for less investment, \non the other hand it enables franchisees to enter into a market more easily since the \nbusiness is based on an established brand and/or on a proven business model. That is, \nfranchising means less risk and low costs for both parties with higher chances of \nsurviving within the first years of business. \n\n\n[10] \n \n2.1.4 \nStages in Franchising  \n2.1.4.1 Conduct a feasibility study \nDeveloping a feasibility study will provide potential franchisors with an outlook for \ndeciding to proceed with franchising and help them in planning of the subsequent steps. \nThe following factors should be considered: \na. Test the system \nApplying the developed franchising system in at least one pilot unit on the same or \nsimilar market can help the potential franchisors to test the operational aspects of their \nbusiness model and help them to perceive the possible defects before the launch of the \nfranchising. The pilot unit should preferably be run by the staff of the potential \nfranchisor or even a pilot franchisee. \nb. Take particular care when developing the agreement \nThe key terms in franchising agreements are similar to those in IP licensing agreements. \nHowever, particular attention should be paid to the conformity with the Commercial \nlaw in Kenya and the conditions for providing goods/services to the franchisee during \nrunning of the system. \n2.1.4.2 Launching your franchise \ni. \nAdvertising: advertising campaigns and publicity materials are important in \npromoting the franchise system. \nii. \nSelection of franchisees: developing criteria for the recruitment process of \nfranchisees has utmost importance on the success of the franchise. \niii. \nFranchise disclosure document: during the negotiations, it is a best practice to \nprepare a franchise disclosure document which encompasses detailed \ninformation about the franchisor, franchising system, related IP, references and \nfinancial figures, among others.   \niv. \nDue diligence: potential franchisees should carry out a due diligence audit to \ndetect potential risks, which may arise during the franchise. Such an audit may \n\n\n[11] \n \ninclude verification of the related IP, financial and business information about \nthe franchisor, sufficiency of the goods/services, training and assistance to be \nprovided by the franchisor, among others.  \n2.1.4.3 Joint Ventures (JVs) \nJVs are business alliances of two or more independent organisations (venturers) to \nundertake a specific project or achieve a certain goal by sharing risks. IP has an \nimportant role in the creation of such collaborations, since venturers bring their own \nintellectual assets for the success of a JV and they should agree on their initial \ncontributions, responsibilities and obligations within the alliance as set out in JV \nagreements. \nAdvantages of Joint Ventures  \ni. \nGives opportunity to exploit and share IP assets with reduced financial \ninvestment \nii. \nAllows enterprises to access new markets by sharing risks \niii. \nCreates possibilities to leverage existing technologies and patents developed by \neach venturer \niv. \nProvides enterprises with the chances to develop new IP with less investment \nv. \nAllows utilization of unused IP assets. \n2.1.4.4 Key Terms in the JV Agreements \ni. \nJoint ventures agreements must be in writing.  \nii. \nBackground, foreground and access rights: in JVs, the venturers bring into the \nproject their previously owned IP assets - which are known as background - and \nthey should decide on the access rights to their background for other venturers. \nFurthermore, the project implementation will also generate IP, which is referred \nto as IP foreground or results. The ownership of foreground/results and \ndetermination of access rights should be clarified before entering into a JV \n\n\n[12] \n \npartnership together with compensation of IP registration and/or maintenance \ncosts. \niii. \nIP rights specific terms: \na. Patents: since any prior use or public disclosure will ban the invention \nfrom being patented, internal and external measures should be adopted \nto avoid any leak of information. The parties should share information \ninternally to identify if some form of prior art would be an impediment \nto future patent filings. \nb. Trademarks: licensing conditions and geographical restrictions, as well \nas precise termination rights, should be clearly defined. The venturers \nshould also agree on the terms to limit the use of the new trade marks \nto a confined geographical area or product range after JV termination. \nc. Confidential Business Information: all possible confidentiality measures \nshould be taken to safeguard such valuable business information. \niv. \nHandling the partnership issues in JVs: the conditions of accepting new \npartners as well as exit of current partners must be defined. Actions in the case \nof insolvency of partners should also be clarified. \nv. \nContributions of each partner: the financial contribution of each partner to the \nJV in terms of intangibles should be defined. \nvi. \nJV management: the management structure of JVs should be defined. For \nexample, an IP management committee for operational IP matters such as patent \nfilings, licensing and disputes can be agreed upon. Specific importance should be \ngiven to IP exploitation management. \nvii. \nTermination of JVs: termination clauses on IP and related rights in the case of \ntermination of JVs should be provided.  \nviii. \nOthers: insurances and IP advisory (if any) should also be included. \n \n\n\n[13] \n \n2.1.4.5 IP considerations during the life span of JVs \nJoint ventures can be subdivided into the following four phases and there are essential \nIP-related issues to be taken into account in each of the stages. \na. IP considerations in the pre-contractual stage: \ni. \nPartners should protect their own background IP assets before bringing them into \nthe project. \nii. \nAn NDA should be signed between the parties before disclosing any confidential \ninformation. \niii. \nConducting an IP due-diligence study is advisable in order to define each party‘s \ncontribution to the JV (with their background IP) and to establish whether the IP \nrights cover the required technical field and geographical area. \niv. \nJVs must be shaped in a way that is not destructive to free competition in the \ncommon market. Therefore, when creating JVs, a careful consideration of \nrelated competition law is highly recommended. \nOtherwise, if the JV is found to be intended for formation of a monopoly, the deal can \nbe annulled by the public authorities. \nb. IP considerations in the contractual stage: \ni. \nPartners should agree on whether the background IP will be assigned or licensed \n(or sub-licensed) to other partners for project implementation. Background \nrights are usually licensed since the owner can have continuous control over \nthem. During the negotiations, venturers should discuss the terms of license, if \nlicenses are granted. \nii. \nJoint venturers should start discussions on handling the ownership issues for \nforeground IP/results. At this stage, they should agree on whether to include \njoint ownership clauses within the main JV agreement or deal with jointly owned \nIP on a case-by-case basis using distinct JV agreements. \nc.  IP considerations in the implementation stage: \n\n\n[14] \n \ni. \nParties should decide who will own the foreground rights and who will exploit \nthem. The law generally provides that rights to foreground made in the course \nof the JV will belong to the inventing party. However, as it is not always very \neasy to ascertain the individual contribution to foreground IP. A joint ownership \nagreement should clearly state the proportion and manner in which those rights \nare to be held by venturers. An equal sharing of rights on ownership, exploitation \nand/or enforcement may be considered. \nii. \nParties should decide the ownership of the improvements of an already existing \nbackground, made by one of the venturers. It should be noted that background \nimprovements are often claimed by the background owner.  \niii. \nIf exploitation activities will not be carried out by the JV itself, parties can carry \non such activities individually. Instead, venturers also assign their rights to access \nforeground to other parties for its exploitation. It must be noted that venturers \nmay need to grant access to their background for it to be used together with \nforeground in the exploitation phase. \nd. IP considerations in the termination stage: \ni. \nPartners should agree on the precise terms for termination of the JV or for the \npossible exit of a venturer. \nii. \nArrangements on all necessary steps for termination of access rights such as \nlicenses (if any) should be made. \n3.0 \nHandling Industrial Property Rights arising from other Commercial \nAgreements  \nTechnology transfer arrangement may be internal (e.g. transfer of knowledge between \nemployer and employee) or external (e.g. transfer of knowledge between different \npartners in a project). This facilitates development of new and improved product or \nservices and paves the way for technological advances. \nIn addition to the mechanisms explained previously, knowledge, technology and \ntherefore IP – can also be transferred through other contractual instruments that occur \n\n\n[15] \n \nin the ordinary course of doing business. This have been referred in this guide as IP \nelements in other commercial agreements and their use is explained in this section. \n3.1.1 \nNon-Disclosure Agreements \nNon-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are legally binding contracts establishing the \nconditions under which one party (the disclosing party) discloses information in \nconfidence to another party (the receiving party). The common characteristic of these \nagreements is that the disclosed information is valuable for the disclosing party to the \nextent that it must be kept away from the public domain.  \nTherefore, an NDA is a tool to be used to reduce the risks for possible disclosure of \ninformation, when there is a need to grant access to confidential information, e.g. \nwhen entering into a partnership such as licensing. \n3.1.1.1 What to consider in NDAs \ni. \nClearly define the “confidential information”. \nii. \nDescribe any restrictions on use of confidential information by the receiving \nparty. \niii. \nProvide the list of information not covered by the agreement. \niv. \nDefine the duration of “obligation for confidentiality” (unlimited or a period of \ntime). \n3.1.2 \nMaterial Transfer Agreements \nMaterial Transfer Agreements (MTAs) are used when exchanging tangible materials \nbetween parties to secure the IP rights of the material provider against possible \ndisclosure by the recipient party. \nThe material exchanged can take many forms, such as product samples, prototypes, \nsoftware, chemical compounds or biological materials etc. Generally such a transfer \noccurs during: \ni. \nFeasibility studies to check whether the material is compatible with the recipient \nfacilities; \n\n\n[16] \n \nii. \nResearch activities on the material in R&D partnerships; and \niii. \nProvision of samples or prototypes to future clients for trials etc. \n3.1.2.1 Steps to drafting MTAs \ni. \nClearly define the material(s) transferred. \nii. \nEstablish the limitations on how the recipient can use the transferred \nmaterial(s). \niii. \nIf the transferred material(s) is (are) subject to further improvements or \nresearches, define the ownership of the results and access rights. \niv. \nState the confidentiality obligations. \nv. \nDefine the duration of the agreement. \n3.1.3 \nConsortium Agreements (CAs) \nConsortium Agreements (CAs) are contracts, made between “consortium partners”, to \nset out rights and obligations during a temporary partnership for the purposes of \ncarrying out a specific project. CAs minimize the probability of later disputes as they \nprovide rules and responsibilities for the parties during the project together with the \naccess rights to be granted to the partners concerning the project results. \n3.1.3.1 What to consider in CAs \ni. \nDefine the project and the project period. \nii. \nDescribe the management rules of the consortium including the IP management \nscheme. \niii. \nProvide the list of background IP provided by each consortium partner and define \nthe related access rights and conditions. \niv. \nSet out the rules for exploitation and dissemination of results such as: \n who owns the results;  \n access rights of other partners; \n\n\n[17] \n \n responsibilities with regard to IP protection of results; \n provisions for transfer of ownership and involvement of third parties; and \n other responsibilities for exploitation and dissemination e.g. publications and \nhandling confidential information in promotional activities, among others. \nv. \nResponsibilities of the partners with regard to enforcement. \n3.1.4 \nContract Research & Development  \nContract Research and Development (R&D) is usually used by companies to outsource \nthe R&D activities to universities or research centres for the purpose of acquiring new \nknowledge, when the company has no internal resources to carry out these activities. \n3.1.4.1 What to consider in contract R&D \ni. \nDefine the need and the project period (outsourced R&D activity). \nii. \nDescribe each party‘s contribution (e.g. market know-how from enterprises, \nR&D activities from the third party). \niii. \nDefine the ownership and access rights to results (commonly in contract R&D \nagreements, the enterprise owns all the generated IP and provides limited \naccess rights to the third party). \n3.1.5 \nConsultancy Agreement \nSuch agreements are established between organisations willing to provide advice to \nenterprises on specific matters, in return for payment of a fee. Enterprises engage in \nthese partnerships for different objectives, such as to get assistance to overcome a \ntechnical problem, or to analyse a concrete technical matter or data. \n3.1.5.1 What to consider in consultancy agreements \ni. \nSign an NDA or add confidentiality clauses in the agreement, as the consultant \nmay have access to sensitive business information during the consultancy \nperiod. \n\n\n[18] \n \nii. \nClarify the ownership of the IP which is created by the consultant during the \nconsultancy period. IP developed by a consultant is owned by the consultant \n- not by the client - unless there is an agreement that provides otherwise."}]}, "file_content_type": "application/pdf"},

They are meant to assist the examiners and other Patent Division \nStaff to consistently apply the Act and the Regulations. However, they cannot be expected to \ncover all possible situations. The Guidelines are in essence the first step on the long journey \nof continuous improvement and towards establishment of standards for processing industrial \nproperty rights applications in the Institute. The Guidelines will be adapted where necessary \nto reflect the results of a learning process. More so decisions made by the Managing \nDirector, Industrial Property Tribunal and High Court as provided for in the Industrial \nProperty Act and the Regulations may serve to elaborate and enrich these guidelines.  \n \nFurther, it needs to be noted that the realms of industrial property covered in these \nguidelines is quite dynamic and therefore changes in the provisions of the Act and the \nregulations are expected. Such changes will need to be reflected in the guidelines in order to \nmaintain their relevance for day to day use in the Institute.  \n \nAny comments on these Guidelines and any subsequent changes will always be welcome. \nSuch comments should be directed to: \n \nThe Managing Director \nKenya Industrial Property Institute, \nP. O. Box 51648 – 00200, \nNairobi. \nTel: 254-2-602210/1 \nEmail: kipi@swiftkenya.com \n\n\nii \nAcknowledgement \nPreparation of Guidelines for the examination of Patents, Utility Models and Industrial \nDesigns was inspired and driven by the desire of the patent Division’s Staff to standardize \nand improve on the procedures for processing applications for patents, utility models and \nindustrial designs. Consequently the staff contributed greatly to the development of these \nguidelines. I wish to recognize the efforts of all who were involved in one way or another. \nOn behalf of the committee tasked to come up with the Guidelines, I am grateful for the \ncooperation and support that was received from other members of staff. I recognize the \nefforts of those who found time and made efforts to avail their comments and constructive \ncriticism formally and informally for they helped shape this document. \n \nSpecial acknowledgement goes to the team that dedicatedly worked on the final draft to \nensure that it was ready and specifically recognize the efforts of Mr.  Paul M. Chege (Senior \nTrademarks Examiner), Mr. Fredrick O. Omiti (Senior Patent Examiner), Mrs Eunice W. \nNjuguna (Chief Legal Officer), Mr. David N. Njuguna (Patent Examiner) and Mr. Reuben \nLangat (Senior Patent Examiner) for they went beyond the call of their duty to pursue the \nfinalization of this document. \n \nThe Managing Director, Prof. James Otieno Odek, in a special way contributed to the \nformulation of this document. He continually encouraged the committee to finalize the \ncompilation of the document. Most of all he provided the required resources for the \ncompletion of this work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMr. Joseph M.

guidelines give instructions as to the practice and procedure to be followed in the \nvarious aspects of processing industrial property applications and more specifically to grant \nand registration of patents, utility models and industrial designs in accordance with the \nIndustrial Property Act 2001(the Act) and the Industrial Property Regulations 2002 (the \nRegulations). However, adherence to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the rules made and the \nadministrative instructions issued thereunder are to be observed in dealing with international \npatent applications as far as the same are given effect under the Industrial Property Act \n2001 and any amendments thereafter. The same also applies to Harare Protocol with respect \nto regional applications. \n \nThe Guidelines are not intended to, and cannot, add to or subtract from the provisions of the \nAct or the Regulations. They are meant to assist the examiners to consistently apply the Act \nand the Regulations to the examination procedure, but they cannot be expected to cover all \npossible situations. The Institute and the users of the system understand that for all \nconcerned there will be a learning process. The Guidelines will be adapted where necessary \nto reflect the results of that learning process. \n \nReference in these guidelines to a section, followed by a number, is to be construed as \nreference to the Act and reference to a regulation will be construed as reference to the \nRegulations.  \n \n1.2 \nContacts of the Institute \nThe Institute is located in Nairobi South \"C\", Popo Road, off Mombasa Road, Weights and \nMeasures premises, P. O. Box 51648 - 00200, Nairobi, Telephone No. 602210/602211. Fax: \n606312. Email: kipi@swiftkenya.com or info@kipi.go.ke. Website: \n1.3 \nBusiness hours \nThe Registry is open to the public from 9.00 am to 1.00pm and 2.00 pm to 4.00 pm each \nday from Monday to Friday. If the last day for filing a document falls on a Saturday, a \nSunday or on a public holiday, the document may be filed on the next day following the \nSaturday, Sunday or the public holiday. \n1.4 \nInternational conventions and treaties  \nKenya is a member of a number of international treaties and conventions in the field of \nintellectual property. Such instruments have a direct bearing on the procedures and \nstandards adopted in dealing with industrial property matters. The treaties and conventions \ninclude:- \n1.4.1  \nParis convention  \nThe Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property contains provisions in regard to \nnational treatment and right of priority which are domesticated in the Act.  \n \n1.4.2 \nTrade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) \nAgreement \nThis is part of the multilateral trade agreements made under the general agreements in \ntariffs and trade (referred to as the GATT Agreement). It covers a wide range of intellectual \n\n\n \n2 \nproperty aspects and sets out the minimum standards of protection to be provided by each \nmember of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). \n1.4.3  \nPatent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) \nPatent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) is a system for filing international patent applications. It is \nadministered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Under the PCT, an \napplicant can file a patent application in all the member countries through a single \napplication.  \n1.4.4  \nHarare Protocol \n \nThe Harare Protocol is administered by the African Regional Intellectual Property \nOrganization (ARIPO). The protocol empowers ARIPO to grant patents and register industrial \ndesigns and utility models on behalf of the contracting states. 1.5 IP Forms \n \nThe prescribed forms for requesting any office actions are provided for in the First Schedule \nto the Regulations.  \n1.6 \nFees \nThe Act and the Regulations prescribe a schedule of fees payable to the Institute for various \nservices. The prescribed fees are set out in the Second Schedule to the Regulations. Fees \nmust be paid in Kenya Shillings by local applicants and US$ by foreign applicants. Payments \nmade in other currencies will not be accepted. The fees should be remitted to the Institute \neither by cash or cheque.  \n1.7 \nFiling of documents.   \nDocuments may be sent by post or filed in person. Where documents are sent by post the \ndate of receipt at the Institute shall be deemed to be the date that the Institute receives the \ndocument. Once documents are properly received and stamped, they become part of the file \nkept by the Institute and may not be returned unless they were submitted by error. \n1.8 \nIndustrial Property Journal \nThe Industrial Property Journal (the Journal), is a statutory monthly publication of the \nInstitute for the purpose of advertising industrial property applications and for publishing \nother matters required to be published under the Act;  \n \n1.9 \nRepresentation before the Institute (Sec. 34(2) )  \nNatural or legal persons not having either their domicile or their principal place of business or \na real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in Kenya must appoint an agent \nto act for them in all proceedings. If an application is made in these circumstances and an \nagent has not been appointed, the applicant will be requested in the examination report to \ndo so.  \n \nA representative shall be appointed through IP Form No. 39 for each application filed; and a \npayment of the requisite fees. \n\n\n \n3 \nPART II: PATENTS AND UTILITY MODELS \n \nChapter 1: \n Filing of documents and filing date examination \n1.1 \nPersons entitled to file an application  \nAn application for the grant and registration of a Kenyan patent, utility model, or industrial \ndesign may be filed by the inventor or any other person to whom she has transferred the \nright. It is presumed that a legal entity does not have the ability to invent or create but \nrather it is the natural persons working for the legal entity. It is on this basis that it is \nnecessary when a legal entity is filing the application, the application be accompanied by a \nstatement justifying the applicants right to a patent (S34 (3); R12 (8)). Such statement shall \nbe furnished on Form IP 4 or  assignment documents.  \n  \n1.2 \nReception of documents   \nAll documents relating to patents, utility models and designs are received at the front office \nof the patent registry and the date of receipt is stamped upon receipt of the documents. The \ndate of receipt should be applied as not to obliterate any part of the document or make \nthem unsuitable for direct reproduction.   \n \nUpon capturing the receipt of any application, the computer system generates the \napplication number automatically. The application is then forwarded to the accounts section \nfor reception of the applicable fees. From the accounts section the application is taken back \nto the front office for data capture. The application is then forwarded to the registry where  \na physical file is opened and the file is assigned to an examiner in the relevant field.   \n \nAll pages of any document received in respect of a new application should be marked with \nthe application number. In addition, copies of all correspondence issued by the Institute \nshould be included in the file, filed in chronological order in which the correspondence is sent \nto the applicant. \n1.3 \nFiling date  \nThe first task for the examiner is to determine whether the application meets the \nrequirements for according the filing date. These requirements are prescribed under section \n41 of the Act as the name of the applicant, description, claims and drawings where \nnecessary. \n \nThe documents referred to above should be in English but do not have to meet any \nparticular requirements as to form or presentation. It is essential however they be \nsufficiently legible to enable the information to be discerned. The applicant should be \nconsidered sufficiently identified whenever it is possible to establish the identity of the \napplicant beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of all data contained in the documents filed. \nWhere there is more than one applicant each applicant must be similarly identified. No \nobjection should be raised at this stage with regard to the status of the applicant or his \nentitlement to apply. The contents of the description and claims do not require close \nscrutiny.  It will be sufficient to identify a document which appears to include description and \none or more claims. \n \nIf the application does not fulfil these requirements the examiner is required to invite the \napplicant, within 14 days from the date of the examination, to submit the required \ncorrection. The invitation should indicate that the applicant has 60 days to comply. If the \n\n\n \n4 \napplicant does not comply with the invitation and, as a result, the examiner treats the \napplication as if it had not been filed, the examiner should, within fourteen days, inform the \napplicant in writing. \n \nWhere an application meets the aforementioned requirements, the receiving date becomes \nthe filing date and the same must be so communicated to the applicant in writing. \n\n\n \n5 \nChapter II: \nFormalities procedure for patent applications  \n(Sec. 41(7) Regulation 24 (4)) \n2.0 \nIntroduction \nBefore the application is accepted to proceed for search and substantive examination, the \nexaminer will carry out formality examination to determine whether the application complies \nwith the provisions of the Act and the Regulations as detailed below. The purpose of \nformality examination is to ascertain conformity of the application to the physical \nrequirements. These physical requirements are necessary to facilitate easy storage, search, \nretrieval and reproduction of the patent documents and comprehension of the subject matter \nof the application. (isn’t this part of substantive examination?) \n2.1 \nRequest (IP Form 3) sec. 34   \nThe examiner should check whether the request complies with the following:- \n• \nThe request for grant is based on a provisional or a final specification denoted by \nmarking the appropriate boxes on the form. If it is a provisional specification, the \nexaminer should inform the applicant that the final specification is due within one \nyear from the filing date and that the Institute will not process the application until \nthe final specification is filed. \n• \nIt states the name, address, nationality and country of residence of the applicant,  \n• \nIt states the name and address of the inventor  \n• \nIt states the name and address of the agent where necessary.  \n• \nIf there is more than one applicant, the request should set out, in addition to an \naddress for each applicant, a single address at which all the applicants can be \ncontacted. \n• \nFor each inventor, the request should be accompanied by an extra copy of the \nstatement if there is more than one inventor \n \n2.2 \nTitle of the invention \nWith regard to the title of the invention it should be checked to ascertain whether it is short \nand precise, as required under section 34(3) of the Act. \n \nForm IP 3 must also contain the title of the invention.  The title must clearly and concisely \nstate the technical designation of the invention and must exclude all fancy names. The \nexaminer should take the following into account: \n• \npersonal names, fancy names, the word \"patent\" or similar terms of a non-technical \nnature which do not  serve to identify the invention should not be used; \n• \nthe abbreviation \"etc.\", being vague, should not be used and should be replaced by \nan indication of what it is intended to cover; \n• \ntitles such as \"Method\", \"Apparatus\", \"Chemical Compounds\" alone o7 r similar vague \ntitles do not meet the requirement that the title must clearly state the technical \ndesignation of the invention; \n• \ntrade names and trade marks should also not be used; the examiner, however, need \nonly intervene when names are used which, according to common general \nknowledge, are trade names or trade marks. \n \n2.3 \nDescription \nWith regard to description of the invention, it should be ascertained that it  \na) states the title of the invention; \nb) specifies the technical field to which the invention relates; \n\n\n \n6 \nc) indicates the background art which, as far as it is known to the applicant, can be \nregarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the \ninvention; and \nd) indicates how the invention is industrially applicable. \n \n2.4 \nClaims \nWith respect to claims, they should be checked to find out whether they set out:- \na) the technical features that are necessary to define the subject matter of the invention \nbut that are part of the prior art (the preamble); and \nb) the technical features that, in combination with the features referred to in \nsubparagraph (a), define that for which protection is sought (the body). \nIt should be noted that the features set out in the claim under paragraph (b) above should \nbe preceded by an appropriate transition. Such transitions may be words such as \n“characterized in that”, “characterized by”, “wherein the improvement comprises” or any \nother words to the same effect.  \n \nIf the application contains more than ten claims, the applicant should be requested to pay \nexcess claims fee. \n \n2.5 \nForm and content of claims \na) \nTechnical features \nThe claims must be drafted in terms of the \"technical features of the invention\". This means \nthat claims should not contain any statements relating, for example, to commercial \nadvantages or other non-technical matters, but statements of purpose should be allowed if \nthey assist in defining the invention.  \n \nb) \nTwo-part format \nA claim should be drafted in two part format. The first   part (normally called the preamble) \nshould contain a statement indicating the designation of the subject-matter of the invention \ni.e. the general technical class of apparatus, process, etc. to which the invention relates, \nfollowed by a statement of those technical features which are necessary for the definition of \nthe claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art.  \n \nThis statement of prior-art features is applicable only to independent claims and not to \ndependent claims. It is clear that it is necessary only to refer to those prior art features \nwhich are relevant to the invention. For example, if the invention relates to a photographic \ncamera but the inventive step relates entirely to the shutter, it would be sufficient for the \nfirst part of the claim to read: \"A photographic camera including a focal plane shutter\" and \nthere is no need to refer also to the other known features of a camera such as the lens and \nview-finder.  \n \nThe second part or \"characterising portion\" should state the features which the invention \nadds to the prior art, i.e. the technical features for which, in combination with the features \nstated in sub-paragraph (a) (the first part), protection is sought. \n \nc) \nCategories \nThere are different \"categories\" of claim (\"products, process, apparatus or use\"). For many \ninventions, claims in more than one category are needed for full protection. In fact, there are \nonly two basic kinds of claim, viz. claims to a physical entity (product, apparatus) and claims \n\n\n \n7 \nto an activity (process, use). The first basic kind of claim (\"product claim\") includes a \nsubstance or compositions (e.g. chemical compound or a mixture of compounds) as well as \nany physical entity (e.g. object, article, apparatus, machine, or system of co-operating \napparatus) which is produced by a person's technical skill. Examples are: \"a steering \nmechanism incorporating an automatic feed-back circuit ...\"; \"a woven garment comprising \n...\"; \"an insecticide consisting of X, Y, Z\"; or \"a communication system comprising a plurality \nof transmitting and receiving stations\". The second basic kind of claim (\"process claim\") is \napplicable to all kinds of activities in which the use of some material product for effecting the \nprocess is implied; the activity may be exercised upon material products, upon energy, upon \nother processes (as in control processes) or upon living things. \n \nd) \nIndependent and dependent claims \nAll applications will contain one or more \"independent\" claims directed to the essential \nfeatures of the invention. Any such claim may be followed by one or more claims concerning \n\"particular embodiments\" of that invention.  \n \nAny claim which includes all the features of any other claim is termed a \"dependent claim\". \nSuch a claim must contain, if possible at the beginning, a reference to the other claim, all \nfeatures of which it includes. Since a dependent claim does not by itself define all the \ncharacterising features of the subject-matter which it claims, expressions such as \n\"characterised in that\" or \"characterised by\" are not necessary in such a claim but are \nnevertheless permissible. A claim defining further particulars of an invention may include all \nthe features of another dependent claim and should then refer back to that claim. Also, in \nsome cases, a dependent claim may define a particular feature or features which may \nappropriately be added to more than one previous claim (independent or dependent). It \nfollows that there are several possibilities: a dependent claim may refer back to one or more \nindependent claims, to one or more dependent claims, or to both independent and \ndependent claims. \ne) \nArrangement of claims \nAll dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim and those referring back to \nseveral previous claims must be grouped together to the extent and in the most appropriate \nway possible. The arrangement must therefore be one which enables the association of \nrelated claims to be readily determined and their meaning in association to be readily \nconstrued.  \n \n2.6 \nDrawings \nIf the specification contains drawings, the examiner should ascertain that they comply with \nthe following — \na) that they are not coloured; \nb) that the lines of the drawings are be black, durable, uniformly thick and well-defined.  \nc) that the drawings are such that all details can be distinguished without difficulty \nwhen the drawings are reproduced photographically at two thirds their actual size; \nd) that all numbers, letters and other references signs are at least .32 centimetres high \nand are circled or within brackets or inverted commas; \ne) that all features shown in the drawings are disclosed in the description and vice \nversa. \nf) that the different figures in the drawings are numbered consecutively in Arabic \nnumerals. \ng) that the drawings do not include text. \n \n\n\n \n8 \nWhere the application refers to drawings which are not included in the application, the \nexaminer should invite the applicant to furnish the missing drawings, and, if the applicant \ncomplies with the invitation, the filing date should re-dated to the date of receipt of the \nmissing drawings. If the applicant does not comply with the invitation any reference to the \ndrawings should be treated as non-existent. \n \n2.7 \nAbstract. \nThe examiner is to ascertain that the application contains an abstract. If the abstract is \npresent the examiner should check whether it starts on a new page and whether it \nincludes — \n(a)  \nthe title of the invention;  \n(b) \na summary of the disclosure included in the description.  \nThe summary should indicate the technical field to which the invention relates and the \nprincipal use or uses of the invention. The abstract should not include statements about the \nmerits or value of the invention or about uses that are speculative. It should not contain \nmore than one hundred and fifty words. It should try as much as possible to capture the \nmost relevant terms defining the invention. \n \n2.8 \nGeneral requirements  \nThe examiner should check to make sure that the application meets the following general \nrequirements; \n1) That the application is in triplicate. \n2) That each of the following is numbered as a separate series, using Arabic numerals with \nthe numbers centred at the top of the sheets but not in the top margin — \na) the request; \nb) the description, claims and abstract; and \nc) the drawings. \n3) That every fifth line of the description and the claims is numbered with the number \nappearing to the left of the line but not in the margin. \n4) That all parts of the application are prepared so that they are legible when they are \nphotocopied or otherwise reproduced. \n5) That the form of appointment of agent is filed (form IP 39) and the fee is paid. \n6) That there is statement justifying applicant’s right to patent if the applicant is not the \ninventor (form IP 4). \n \n2.9 \nAdditional formalities requirements for applications relating to living \nmatter. \nIf an application relates to a micro-biological process or the product thereof and involves the \nuse of a micro-organism which is not available to the public and which cannot be described \nin the patent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a \nperson skilled in the art, the examiner should ascertain that a deposit has been made to \neither KEMRI or KARI which are the recognized depository institutions for the purpose of \npatenting in Kenya by the date of filing the application. \n \nThe examiner should check whether the application provides the name of the depository \ninstitution and the file number of the culture deposit. Where the details of the deposited \nculture are not available at the time of filing, the applicant may submit the missing details \nwithin sixteen months from the date of filing or priority. \nIf the application has defects the examiner should invite the applicant to remedy the defects \nwithin 90 days from the date of the invitation. The applicant may apply for extension of this \n\n\n \n9 \ntime by filing form IP 7 and paying the requisite fee. Such extension should not exceed 60 \ndays. If the applicant does not comply with the invitation, the application should be rejected. \n2.10 Publication of the patent application (Sec. 42)  \nThe purpose of the publication is to inform the public of the pending patent application \nbefore the Institute. The patent application should be published after the expiration of \neighteen months from the filing date or, where priority is claimed, the date of priority. In \ncase of patent applications claiming priority, the term of eighteen months is construed from \nthe original filing date and in the case of patent applications with two or more priority claims, \nthe period is construed from the earliest priority dates.  \n \nBefore the application is published the applicant should be invited to pay the publication fee. \nThe Industrial Property Journal should be published monthly at the end of each calendar \nmonth. The technical preparation for the publication of the IP Journal is considered \nterminated on or before the 20th day of every month. Therefore, for any matter that has to \nappear in the Journal in a particular month, the payment should be received by the Institute \nbefore the termination of the technical preparation.   \n2.11  \nWithdrawal of application or priority claim \nIf after termination of the technical preparation the patent application is withdrawn to avoid \npublication, non-publication cannot be guaranteed. To avoid publication of the application \napplicants should at least withdraw their application before the 18th Month from the filing \ndate or where applicable the priority date. In the case of patent applications claiming \npriority, the term of eighteen months is construed from the earliest priority date. If the \napplicant abandons the priority claim, then the publication is deferred provided the \nnotification of the abandonment is received by the Institute before the termination of the \ntechnical preparation for publication. \n\n\n \n10 \n \nChapter III: \nSearch and Substantive Examination \n3.1 \nRequest for substantive examination \nAfter the application meets all formal requirements, the examiner should invite the applicant \nto request for substantive examination by filing form IP8 upon payment of the prescribed \nfee. Where no request is made within the prescribed period of three years, the application \nshall be deemed to be abandoned and the applicant should be informed in writing and the \nfact should be published in the Journal. \n3.2 \nProcedure after request  \nThe Purpose of examination is to ensure that the application and the invention to which it \nrelates meet the requirements set out in the relevant sections of the Act and the \nRegulations.  This chapter deals with search and examination following a request by the \napplicant for the application to be examined as to substance. \n3.3 \nSearch \nThe objective of the search is to discover the prior art relevant for the purpose of \ndetermining whether and if so to what extent, the invention to which the application relates \nis new and involves an inventive step pursuant to sections 22, 23 and 24 of the Act. \n \nThe examination procedure and the preparation of the search opinion depend on the search \nfor the knowledge of the state of the art on which assessment of the patentability of the \ninvention is based. The search must, therefore, be as complete and effective as possible, \nwithin the limitations necessarily imposed by issues such as unity of invention and other \nconsiderations. \n \nThe search is carried out in in-house or external collections of documents or databases, the \ncontents of which are systematically accessible, e.g. by means of words, classification \nsymbols or indexing codes. These are primarily patent documents of various countries, \nsupplemented by a number of articles from periodicals and other non-patent literature. \n \nA report should be prepared containing the results of the search, in particular by identifying \nthe documents constituting the relevant state of the art. \n \nThe search report serves to provide information on the relevant state of the art. it must be \nrealized that in a search, 100% completeness cannot always be obtained, because of such \nfactors as the inevitable imperfections of any information retrieval system and its \nimplementation, and may not be economically justified if the cost is to be kept within \nreasonable bounds.  \n \nFor applications claiming priority, the examiner should request the applicant, under section \n38 (2), to submit copies of any communication received by the applicant concerning the \nresults of any search or examination carried out in respect of the priority application. \n \nThe examiner should for reasons of economy exercise his judgement, based on his \nknowledge of the technology in question and of the available information retrieval systems, \nto omit sections of the documentation in which the likelihood of finding any documents \nrelevant to the search is negligible, for example documents falling within a period preceding \nthe time when the area of technology in question began to develop. \n\n\n \n11 \n3.4 \nSearch in analogous fields \nThe search is carried out in collections of documents or databases which may contain \nmaterial in all those technical fields pertinent to the invention. \n \nThe search strategy should determine the sections of the documentation to be consulted \ncovering all directly relevant technical fields, and may then have to be extended to sections \nof the documentation covering analogous fields, but the need for this must be judged by the \nexaminer in each individual case, taking into account the outcome of the search in the \nsections of the documentation initially consulted. \n \n \nThe decision to extend the search to fields not mentioned in the application must be left to \nthe judgement of the examiner, who should not put himself in the place of the inventor and \ntry to imagine all the kinds of applications of the invention possible. The overriding principle \nin determining the extension of the search in analogous fields should be whether it is \nprobable that a reasonable objection of lack of inventive step could be established on the \nbasis of what is likely to be found by the search in these fields  \n \n3.5 \nThe subject of the search \nBasis for the search \nThe search should be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description \nand drawings (if any). The claims determine the extent of the protection which will be \nconferred by the patent if granted. \n \n3.6 \nInterpretation of claims  \nThe search should on the one hand not be restricted to the literal wording of the claims, but \non the other hand should not be broadened to include everything that might be derived by a \nperson skilled in the art from a consideration of the description and drawings. The objective \nof the search is to discover prior art which is relevant to novelty and/or inventive step . The \nsearch should be directed to what appear to be the essential features of the invention and \ntake into account any changes in the (objective) technical problem underlying the invention \nwhich may occur during the search as a result of the retrieved prior art. In this regard it \nshould be noted that although explicit references in the claims to features elucidated in the \ndescription are only permissible where \"absolutely necessary\". Claims containing such \nreferences should still be searched if these technical features are unambiguously defined by \nspecific parts of the description. \n \nWhen interpreting claims for the purpose of the search, the search will also take into \nconsideration prior art incorporating technical features which are well known equivalents to \nthe technical features of the claimed invention, which may undermine inventive step. \n \n3.7 \nAmended claims \nWhere an application derives from an international application, the applicant may have \namended the international application in the international phase, either after receipt of the \ninternational search report (Art.19(1) PCT) or during international preliminary examination \n(Art. 34(2)(b) PCT). The applicant may then specify that he wishes to enter the phase with \nthese or otherwise amended application documents (including claims) according. \n \n\n\n \n12 \n3.8 \nAbandonment of claims  \nFor applications, claims that are deemed to have been abandoned for non-payment of fees \nmust be excluded from the search. This applies both to searches to be carried out in respect \nof directly-filed applications and to supplementary searches to be carried out in respect of \nPCT applications entering the national phase. \n  \n3.9 \nAnticipation of amendments to claims \nIn principle, and insofar as possible and reasonable, the search should cover the entire \nsubject-matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be \nexpected to be directed after they have been amended . \n \nFor example, where an application relating to an electric circuit contains one or more claims \nonly directed to the function and manner of operation, and the description and drawings \ninclude an example with a detailed non-trivial transistor circuit, the search should include this \ncircuit. \n \n3.10 Broad claims \nNo special search effort need be made for searching unduly wide or speculative claims, \nbeyond the extent to which they relate to matter which is sufficiently disclosed in the \napplication, and are supported by the description (Art. 84). If, for example, in an application \nrelating to and describing in detail an automatic telephone exchange, the claims are directed \nto an automatic communication switching centre, the search should not be extended to \nautomatic telegraph exchanges, data switching centres etc. merely because of the broad \nwording of the claim, but only if it is probable that such an extended search could produce a \ndocument on the basis of which a reasonable objection as regards lack of novelty or \ninventive step could be established.  \n \nLikewise, if a claim is directed to a process for manufacturing an \"impedance element\" but \nthe description and drawings relate only to the manufacture of a resistor element, and give \nno indication as to how other types of impedance element could be manufactured by the \nprocess of the invention, extension of the search to embrace, say, manufacture of capacitors \nwould not normally be justified.  \n \nIf the main claim relates to the chemical treatment of a substrate, whereas it appears from \nthe description or all the examples that the problem to be solved is solely dependent on the \nnature of natural leather, it is clear that the search should not be extended to the fields of \nplastics, fabrics or glass.  \n \nSimilarly, if the description and drawings are directed to a lock with a safety cylinder \nwhereas the claims refer to a device allowing the indexation of the angular position of a first \nelement with respect to two other rotating elements, then the search should be limited to \nlocks. In cases where the lack of disclosure or support is such as to render a meaningful \nsearch over the whole of the scope of the claim(s) impossible, a partial search or a \ndeclaration taking the place of a search report. \n \n3.11 Independent and dependent claims \nThe search carried out in sections of the documentation to be consulted for the independent \nclaim(s) must include all dependent claims. Dependent claims should be interpreted as being \nrestricted by all features of the claim(s) upon which they depend. Therefore, where the \nsubject-matter of an independent claim is novel that of its dependent claims will also be \n\n\n \n13 \nnovel. When the patentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim is not \nquestioned as a result of the search, there is no need to make a further search or cite \ndocuments in respect of the subject-matter of the dependent claims as such.  \n \nFor example, in an application relating to cathode ray oscilloscope tubes, in which the \nindependent claim is directed to specific means along the edge of the front of the tube for \nilluminating the screen and a dependent claim is directed to a specific connection between \nthe front and the main part of the tube, the examiner should, in the sections of the \ndocumentation he consults for searching the illumination means, also search for the \nconnecting means whether in combination with the illumination means or not.  \n \nIf, after this search, the patentability of the illuminating means is not questioned, the \nexaminer should not extend his search for the connecting means to further sections of the \ndocumentation which are likely to contain material pertinent to or specifically provided for \nthese connections.  \n \nIf in an application dealing with a pharmaceutical composition for treating nail infections the \npatentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim relating to specific combinations \nof the active ingredients is not questioned as a result of the search, there is no need to \ncontinue the search for dependent claims dealing with the use of a specific volatile organic \nsolvent as a carrier in the composition. \n \n \n3.12 Search on dependent claims \nHowever, where the patentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim is \nquestioned, it may be necessary for assessing whether the subject-matter of the dependent \nclaim as such is novel and involves an inventive step to continue the search in other sections \nof the documentation, e.g. in one or more additional classification units. No such special \nsearch should be made for features that are trivial or generally known in the art. However, if \na handbook or other document showing that a feature is generally known can be found \nrapidly, it should be cited. When the dependent claim adds a further feature (rather than \nproviding more detail of an element figuring already in the independent claim), the \ndependent claim is to be considered in combination with the features in the independent \nclaim and should be dealt with accordingly. \n \n3.13 Combination of elements in a claim \nFor claims characterised by a combination of elements (e.g. A, B and C) the search should \nbe directed towards the combination. However, when searching sections of the \ndocumentation for this purpose, sub-combinations, including the elements individually (e.g. \nA and B, A and C, B and C, and also A, B and C separately) should be searched in those \nsections at the same time. A search in additional sections of the documentation either for \nsub-combinations or for individual elements of the combination should only be performed if \nthis is still necessary for establishing the novelty of the element in order to assess the \ninventive step of the combination. \n \n3.14 Different categories \nWhen the application contains claims of different categories, all these must be included in \nthe search. However, if a product claim clearly seems to be both new and non-obvious, the \nexaminer should make no special effort to search claims for a process which inevitably \nresults in the manufacture of that product or for use of the product. When the application \ncontains only claims of one category, it may be desirable to include other categories in the \n\n\n \n14 \nsearch. For example, generally, i.e. except when the application contains indications to the \ncontrary, one may assume that in a claim directed to a chemical process, the starting \nproducts form part of the state of the art and need not be searched; the intermediate \nproducts are only searched when they form the subject of one or more claims; but the final \nproducts will always have to be searched, except when they are evidently known. \n \n3.15 Subject-matter excluded from search \nThe examiner may exclude certain subject-matter from his search. These exclusions may \nresult from certain subject-matter not complying with the provisions of the Act relating to \nexclusions from patentability or to susceptibility to industrial application. They may also arise \nwhere the application does not comply with the provisions of the Act to such an extent that a \nmeaningful search is impossible for some or all of the claims, or for a part of a claim, for \nother reasons. \n \n3.16 Lack of unity \nAlso, when the claims of the application do not relate to one invention only, nor to a group \nof inventions linked so as to form a single general inventive concept, the search will normally \nbe restricted to the invention or the linked group of inventions first mentioned in the claims.  \n \n3.17 Technological background \nIn certain circumstances it may be desirable to extend the subject-matter of the search to \ninclude the \"technological background\" of the invention. \nThis would include: \n– \nthe preamble to the first claim, i.e. the part preceding the expression \"characterised \nby\" or \"characterised in that\"; \n– \nthe state of the art which in the introduction of the description of the application is \nsaid to be known, but not identified by specific citations; \n– \nthe general technological background of the invention (often called \"general state of \nthe art\"). \n \n\n\n \n15 \nChapter IV: \nSearch Procedure and Strategy \n4.1 \n \nProcedure prior to searching \nAnalysis of the application when taking up an application to be searched, the examiner \nshould first consider the application in order to determine the subject of the claimed \ninvention. For this purpose he should make a critical analysis of the claims in the light of the \ndescription and drawings. He should in particular consider the content of the claims, \ndescription and drawings sufficiently to identify the problem underlying the invention, the \ninventive concept leading to its solution, the features essential to the solution as found in the \nclaims and the results and effects obtained.  \n \nFurthermore, where technical features which are not present in the claims are indicated in \nthe description as essential for the solution of the stated problem, these features should be \nincluded in the search. \n \n4.2 \n \nFormal deficiencies \nIf the examiner notices any formal shortcomings which have been overlooked during \nformality examination, he may invite the applicant to remedy these deficiencies. Such \ndeficiencies which the examiner might notice include: \n1) physical deficiencies of the application, including: \na) incorrect sequence and/or positioning of page numbering and/or failure to use Arabic \nnumerals in page numbering \nb) presence of drawings in the description and/or claims \nc) presence of erasures and/or alterations in the application documents, such that the \nauthenticity of the content and/other requirements for good reproduction are \njeopardized \n2) presence of prohibited matter in the application: \na) which is contrary to public order. \nb) constituting disparaging statements. \n3) failure to comply with the provisions relating to the deposition of biological material, in \nparticular with regard to the correct identification in the application of the depository \ninstitution and culture deposit number of the biological material assigned to the \ndeposited material by the depository institution.  \n \n4.3 \nDocuments cited in the application \nDocuments cited in the application under consideration should be examined if they are cited \nas the starting point of the invention, as showing the state of the art, or as giving alternative \nsolutions to the problem concerned, or when they are necessary for a correct understanding \nof the application.  \n \nHowever, when such citations clearly relate only to details not directly relevant to the \nclaimed invention, they may be disregarded. In the exceptional case that the application \ncites a document that is not published or otherwise not accessible to the examiner and the \ndocument appears essential to a correct understanding of the invention to the extent that a \nmeaningful search would not be possible without knowledge of the content of that \ndocument, the Examiner should postpone the search and request the applicant to provide a \ncopy of the document.  \n \nIf no copy of the document is received, an attempt is made to carry out the search and then, \nif necessary, a partial search report or, where applicable, a declaration replacing the search \nreport is prepared.  \n\n\n \n16 \n \nThis partial search report or declaration will be issued giving the following grounds: \n(i) \nthe non-availability of the document rendered the invention insufficiently disclosed \nwithin the meaning of section 34(5); and \n(ii) \nthe insufficient disclosure mentioned in (i) existed to such a degree that a meaningful \nsearch was not possible on at least part of the claimed invention. \nIt should also be noted that where the applicant furnishes the document after the search \nreport and the search opinion (if applicable, have been prepared, an additional search on \nthat subject-matter originally excluded from the search may be carried out due to the \ncorrection of the deficiency which led to the partial search.  \n \n4.4 \nAbstract; official classification; title of the invention; publication \nThe examiner should then consider the abstract (together with the title of the invention and \nthe figure, if any, of the drawings to be published with the abstract) in relation to the \nrequirements laid down in the Regulations. Since the abstract should relate to the application \nas filed, the examiner should consider it and determine its definitive content before carrying \nout the search, in order to avoid being inadvertently influenced by the results of the search. \nIf publication of the application is due before the search report is drawn up, the examiner \nhas to establish the official classification of the application much earlier before he carries out \nthe search; he examines then at the same time the abstract for the purpose of publication.  \n \nThis examination of the abstract does not go beyond ensuring that it relates to the \napplication concerned and that no conflict exists with the title of the invention or with the \nclassification of the application. Information in relation to the abstract, the title of the \ninvention and the figure, if any, of the drawings to be published with the abstract should  \ntransmitted to the applicant in the communication accompanying the search report.  \n \n4.5 \n \nSearch strategy \n4.5.1  \nSubject of the search; restrictions \nHaving determined the subject of the invention as outlined above it may be desirable for the \nexaminer to prepare first a search statement, defining the subject of his search as precisely \nas possible. In many instances one or more of the claims may themselves serve this \npurpose, but they may have to be generalised in order to cover all aspects and embodiments \nof the invention.  \n \nAt this time, the considerations relating to subjects excluded from patentability and to lack of \nunity of invention should be borne in mind. The examiner may also have to restrict the \nsearch because the requirements of the Act are not met to such an extent that a meaningful \nsearch is impossible. Any such restrictions to the search must be indicated in the partial \nsearch or declaration taking the place of the search report. \n \n4.5.2  \nFormulating a search strategy \nNext the examiner should start the search process by formulating a search strategy, i.e. a \nplan consisting of a series of search statements expressing the subject of the search, \nresulting in sections of the documentation to be consulted for the search. In its initial phase, \na search strategy will contain one or more combinations of the basic components mentioned \nabove. The search process should be interactive and iterative in the sense that the examiner \nshould reformulate his initial search statement(s) according to the usefulness of the \ninformation retrieved. When using classification units, the examiner should select the \n\n\n \n17 \nclassification units to be consulted for the search, both in all directly relevant fields and in \nanalogous fields. The selection of the classification units in related fields should be limited to: \n(i) \nhigher subdivisions allowing searching by abstraction (generalisation) inasmuch \nas this is justified from a technical viewpoint; and \n(ii) \nparallel subdivisions, bearing in mind the fact that the fields in question will \nbecome increasingly unrelated. \nWhen the examiner is in doubt about the appropriate fields in which to conduct his search, \nhe may request advice from the appropriate supervisor. \n \nUsually various search strategies are possible, and the examiner should exercise his \njudgement, based on his experience and knowledge of the available search tools, to select \nthe search strategy most appropriate to the case in hand. He should give precedence to \nsearch strategies yielding sections of the documentation in which the probability of finding \nrelevant documents is highest. Usually the main technical field of the application will be \ngiven precedence, starting with the basic components most relevant to the specific \nexample(s) and preferred embodiments of the claimed invention. \n \n4.5.3  \nCarrying out the search; types of documents \nThe examiner should then carry out the search, directing his attention to documents relevant \nfor novelty and inventive step. He should also note any documents that may be of \nimportance for other reasons, such as: \n \n(i) conflicting applications which are: \n(a) published  applications   \n(b) published international applications  \nWhen published within the priority interval of the application under search, these \napplications are cited in the search report as \"P\" documents; when published after the \nnational or international filing date, they are cited in the search report as \"E\" documents ; \n \n(ii) documents putting doubt upon the validity of any priority claimed, which are cited in the \nsearch report as \"L\" documents  \n \n(iii) documents contributing to a better or more correct understanding of the claimed \ninvention, which are cited in the search report as \"T\" documents; \n \n(iv) documents illustrating the technological background, which are cited in the search report \nas \"A\" documents, where these documents do not constitute the closest state of the art ; \nand \n \n(v)  patent applications having the same filing or priority date as the application in respect of \nwhich the search is carried out, from the same applicant and relating to the same invention \nand therefore relevant to the issue of double patenting, which are cited in the search report \nas \"L\" documents, but he should not spend a significant amount of time in searching for \nthese documents, nor in the consideration of such matters unless there is a special reason \nfor doing so in a particular case.. \n \nThe examiner should concentrate his search efforts on the use of search strategies yielding \nsections of the documentation in which the probability of finding highly relevant documents \nis greatest, and, in considering whether to extend the search to other less relevant sections \nof the documentation, he should always take account of the search results already obtained. \n \n\n\n \n18 \n4.5.4  \nReformulation of the subject of the search \nThe examiner should continuously evaluate the results of his search, and if necessary \nreformulate the subject of the search accordingly. For example, the selection of the \nclassification units to be searched or the order of searching them may also require alteration \nduring the search as a consequence of intermediate results obtained. The examiner should \nalso use his judgement, taking into account results obtained, in deciding at any time during \nthe systematic search whether he should approach the search documentation in some \ndifferent manner, e.g. by consulting: \n(i) \ndocuments cited in relevant documents produced by the search, for example cited \nin the description or search report of a patent document; or \n(ii) \ndocuments citing a relevant document produced by the search, or whether he \nshould turn to documentation outside that which is available to the Examiner. \nWhen searching external document collections for material in relation to unpublished \nsubject-matter using other than secure connections, like the Internet, the examiner should \nbe extremely careful when formulating search strategies so as not to unwittingly reveal \nconfidential material – i.e. any part of the unpublished patent application. \n \n4.5.5  \nClosest prior art and its effects on the search \nIt may happen that the examiner does not find any documents published before the earliest \npriority date which prejudices the novelty or the inventive step of the claimed invention. In \nsuch cases, the examiner should, whenever possible, cite in the search report at least that \nprior art found in the course of search which discloses a solution to the same problem as \nthat underlying the claimed invention (wherein this problem may change depending on the \nprior art retrieved and wherein the known solution is technically the closest to the claimed \nsolution (\"closest prior art\"). Such prior art is to be cited as an \"A\" document in the search \nreport. \n \nIf such a document cannot be found, the examiner should cite as the closest prior art a \ndocument which solves a problem closely related to the problem underlying the claimed \ninvention and wherein the solution is technically most similar to that of the application under \nsearch. \n \nWhere the examiner retrieves documents which are incidentally prejudicial to the novelty of \nthe claimed invention but which do not affect the inventive step thereof after appropriate \namendment of the application, and does not retrieve any other documents prejudicing \ninventive step, the examiner should also proceed as above. \n \nIn the case of an  national application derived from an international application and being \nsubjected to a supplementary search after entering the national phase , it is possible that the \nexaminer does not uncover any further relevant prior-art documents in the search over and \nabove the documents already cited in the international search report by the International \nSearching Authority. In such cases, it is permissible to have no further relevant documents in \nthe supplementary search report. \n \n4.5.6  \nEnd of search \nReasons of economy dictate that the examiner use his judgement to end his search when \nthe probability of discovering further relevant prior art becomes very low in relation to the \neffort needed. The search may also be stopped when documents have been found clearly \ndemonstrating lack of novelty in the entire subject-matter of the claimed invention and its \nelaborations in the description, apart from features which are trivial or common general \nknowledge in the field under examination, application of which features would not involve \n\n\n \n19 \ninventive step. The search for conflicting applications should, however, always be completed \nto the extent that these are present in the available documentation. \n \n4.5.7  \nPreparation of the search report \nAfter completion of the search, the examiner should select from the documents retrieved the \nones to be cited in the report. These should always include the most relevant documents \n(which will be specially characterised in the report. Less relevant documents should only be \ncited when they concern aspects or details of the claimed invention not found in the \ndocuments already selected for citation. To avoid increasing costs unnecessarily, the \nexaminer should not cite more documents than is necessary and therefore, when there are \nseveral documents of equal relevance, the search report should not normally cite more than \none of them.  Subsequently, the examiner prepares the search report. \n \n4.5.8  \nDocuments discovered after completion of the search \nIt may happen occasionally, that after completion of a search report, the Examiner discovers \nfurther relevant documents (e.g. in a later search for a related application). These \ndocuments should be added to the search report up to the time that preparations for its \npublication are completed. Up to the filing of a request for examination, such later \ndiscovered documents should be communicated to the applicant. Thereafter, such \ndocuments may be used in examination. \n \n4.5.9  \nErrors in the search report \nWhen a material error is found to be present in a search report prior to publication thereof, a \nnew search report will be drawn up which supersedes the preceding one. Where the search \nreport has already been sent to the applicant, the error should immediately be notified to the \napplicant. When a serious error is noted following publication of the application, a \ncorrigendum is published in the Journal. If the error comprises the transmission of an \nincorrect document as a citation, the correct document should be sent. \n \n4.6 \n \nClassification of Patent Applications \nThe official classification of the patent application is performed by the examiner, using the \nclassification symbols contained in the rules of the IPC for the inventions as claimed \n(\"Obligatory Classification\"). He can also assign appropriate classification symbols and/or \nindexing codes to any additional information (\"Non-Obligatory Classification\") as defined in \nthe Guide to the IPC in force at the time. \n \n4.6.1  \nPre-classification (routing) \nThe level of classification at this stage should be as general as practicable on the basis of a \nquick and cursory scrutiny of the document (e.g. the title and independent claim or claims). \nOn the other hand, the level should be specific enough to avoid the need for any \nintermediate stage of preclassification before allocation to the competent section. \n \nThe preclassification required for this first allocation should be made on the basis of the \nindependent claims. If this results in preclassification in more than one sub-class, then \nwhichever of these seems to be the most relevant to the claimed invention (or the invention \nfirst claimed, if there is lack of unity of invention) should be selected.  In most cases no \nfurther classification is required to enable applications to be allotted to the Examiner but, \n\n\n \n20 \nwhere it is necessary, it falls within the authority of the examiner in charge of the field to \narrange for such allotment in an expedient manner. \n \n4.6.2  \nIncorrect preclassification \nIf, on reaching the section, an application has been found to be incorrectly preclassified and \nthus inappropriately allocated, it is reclassified and re-allocated by the section receiving it, \nthe indication on the dossier being appropriately amended.  \n \n4.6.3  \nClassification of the application \nThe classification of the patent application is performed by the examiner as described above. \nPreferably, this should be done when he has studied the content of the application in order \nto carry out the search. However, if publication of the application is due before the search \nreport is drawn up, it is necessary for the examiner to study the application sufficiently to \ndetermine the official classification at this earlier stage. \n \nIf the classification of the application is in more than one sub-class, or more than one main \n(\"00\") group within a sub-class, then all such classifications should be assigned. The \nclassification of the invention as claimed should be distinguished from any additional \nclassification and/or indexing code.  \n \nIn addition, where it is necessary to assign more than one symbol for the invention itself, the \nsymbol which in the examiner's opinion most adequately identifies it, or, when this presents \ndifficulties, the symbol which identifies the invention for which most information is given, \nshould be indicated first, e.g. in order to facilitate subsequent allocation of the applications. \n \nThe classification should be determined without taking into consideration the probable \ncontent of the application after any amendment, since this classification should relate to the \ndisclosure in the published application, i.e. the application as filed. If, however, the \nexaminer's understanding of the invention, or of the content of the application as filed, alters \nsignificantly as a result of the search (e.g. as a result of prior art found or because of \nclarification of apparent obscurities), he should amend the classification accordingly, if the \npreparations for publication have not at that stage been completed. \n \n4.6.4 Classification when the scope of the invention is not clear (e.g. a partial \nsearch) \nWhen the scope of the invention is not clear, the classification has to be based on what \nappears to be the invention insofar as this can be understood. It is then necessary to amend \nit if obscurities are removed by the search. \n \nClassification in cases of a lack of unity of invention \nWhere objection of lack of unity of invention arises, all inventions must be classified, since all \nwill be disclosed in the published application.  \n \nVerification of official classification \nAs a general rule, applications will not be systematically scrutinised after leaving the \nExaminer in order to verify the correctness of the official classification assigned by the \nexaminer.  \n \n\n\n \n21 \n \nChapter V: \nThe State of the Art \n5.1 \nState of the art – oral disclosure, etc. \n \nAccording to section 23(2), oral disclosure, use, exhibition, etc. are recognized as prior art. \nHowever, the examiner, in carrying out a search, should cite an oral description, etc. as prior \nart only if he has available a written confirmation or is otherwise convinced that the facts can \nbe proved. Such references to oral disclosure, prior public use, disclosure by sale, etc. are \nmore usually brought up by opponents in invalidation/ revocation proceedings. \n \n5.2 \nPriority \nIf the claimed priority dates cannot be verified at this stage, uncertainty will exist as regards \ntheir validity and the search for conflicting applications should be extended so as to cover all \npublished applications with an earliest claimed priority date up to the filing date (not the \nclaimed priority date(s)) of the application under consideration. \n \n5.3 \nConflicting applications \nPotentially conflicting national and international applications \nGenerally, where the search is concluded less than eighteen months after the  national or \ninternational filing date of the application (the filing date according to Art. 80 and not its \nclaimed priority date(s)), it will not be possible at the time of the search to make a complete \nsearch for potentially conflicting  national and international applications.  \n \n5.4 \nDate of reference for documents cited in the search report; filing and \npriority date \n \n5.4.1  \nVerification of claimed priority date(s) \nWhere the validity of the priority claim cannot be verified at the search stage, the basic \nreference date for the search must be taken as the date of filing of the application as \naccorded. \n \n5.4.2  \nIntermediate documents \nThe Examiner takes into account documents published between the earliest priority date and \nthe filing date of the application under consideration, and these documents are identified as \nsuch in the search report. For identifying these documents when an application has more \nthan one priority date, the oldest date is to be applied.  \n \nWhen deciding which documents to select for citing in the search report, the examiner refers \nto these dates and should preferably choose any published before the date of priority. Thus, \nfor example, where there are two documents, one published before the date of priority and \nthe other after that date but before the date of filing, but otherwise equally relevant, he \nshould choose the former. \n \n \n\n\n \n22 \n5.5 \nDoubts as to the validity of the priority claim; extension of the Search  \n \nIt is the responsibility of the Examiner to check whether and to what extent the priority claim \nis justified. However, where intervening state of the art or potential state of the art is \nrevealed in the search, the Examiner should, if possible, check the validity of the priority \nclaim. Furthermore, documents showing that a priority claim might not be justified (e.g. an \nearlier application or patent from the same applicant indicating that the application from \nwhich priority is claimed may not be the first application for the invention concerned) should \nbe cited in the search report. However, no special search effort should normally be made for \nthis purpose, except when there is a special reason to do so, e.g. when the priority \napplication is a \"continuation-in-part\" of an earlier application from which no priority is \nclaimed. \n \nSometimes the fact that the country of residence of the applicant is different from the \ncountry of the priority application may also be an indication that it is not a first filing, \njustifying a certain extension of the search. \n \nWhen the search is extended for this purpose, it should be directed to: \n(i) published patent documents filed earlier than the claimed priority date. \n(ii) published patent documents which claim priority from an application filed earlier than the \npriority date of the application being searched. \n \n5.6 \nDocuments published after the filing date \nThe search does not normally take into consideration documents published after the filing \ndate of the application. However, some extension is necessary for specific purposes, and \ncertain other situations may occur in which a document published after the filing date is \nrelevant; examples are a later document containing the principle or theory underlying the \ninvention, which may be useful for a better understanding of the invention, or a later \ndocument showing that the reasoning or the facts underlying the invention are incorrect. The \nsearch should not be extended for this purpose, but documents of this nature known to the \nexaminer could be selected for citation in the report. \n \n5.7 \nNon-prejudicial disclosures \nDisclosures of the invention should not be taken into consideration if they occurred no earlier \nthan six months preceding the filing of the patent application and if they were due to an \nevident abuse in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor, or due to display at an \nofficial, or officially recognised, international exhibition. The Examiner should, nevertheless, \ncite in the search report any documents he has reason to believe is relevant. In this case too \nthe reference date for the search will be the filing date of the application.  \n \n5.8 \nContents of Prior-art Disclosures \n5.8.1  \nGeneral remark \nAs a general rule, the Examiner selects for citation only documents which are present in the \nsearch documentation or which it has access to in some other manner. In that way, no \ndoubt exists about the contents of the documents cited, since the examiner generally has \nphysically inspected each document cited. \n \n\n\n \n23 \n5.8.2 Citation of documents corresponding to documents not available English.  \n \nUnder certain circumstances a document whose contents have not been verified may be \ncited, provided there is justification for the assumption that there is identity of content with \nanother document which the examiner has inspected; both documents should then be \nmentioned in the search report. For example, instead of the document published before the \nfiling date in a language other than English and selected for citation, the examiner may have \ninspected a corresponding document (e.g. another member of the same patent family, or a \ntranslation of an article) in English and possibly published after the filing date. Also it may be \nassumed that, in the absence of explicit indications to the contrary, the contents of an \nabstract are contained in the original document. Further, it should be assumed that the \ncontents of a report of an oral presentation are in agreement with that presentation. \n \n5.9 \nUnity of Invention \n5.9.1  \nGeneral remarks \nIf the Examiner considers that the application does not comply with the requirement of unity \nof invention, he must search it, and draw up the partial search report, for those parts of the \napplication which relate to the invention (or group of inventions forming unity) first \nmentioned in the claims. The partial search report is supplemented with a specification of the \nseparate inventions. \n \nWith regard to the search opinion in cases of a lack of unity of invention, when determining \nwhich invention is the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims, \nthe examiner takes account of the content of the dependent claims, disregarding trivial \nclaims. \n \n5.9.2  \nDecision with respect to unity of invention \nThe examiner should not raise an objection of lack of unity merely because the inventions \nclaimed are classified in separate classification units, or merely for the purpose of restricting \nthe search to certain sections of the documentation, for example, certain classification units. \n \n5.10  \nSubject – matter to be Excluded from the Search \n5.11  \nGeneral remarks \nIn relation to searches, the subject-matter listed in section 21(3) may be considered under \nthe Act as either not to be industrially applicable or, to the extent that the patent application \nrelates to that subject matter as such, to be excluded from patentability, or to constitute an \nexception to patentability under section 26, the claims are not searched in as far as they \nrelate to such subject matter.  \n \nThe Examiner has thus to consider the requirements for patentability other than novelty and \ninventive step. The above-mentioned situations may also occur for only some of the claims \nor for part of a claim. In these cases, this will be indicated in the search or the declaration \ntaking the place of the search report. \n \nMethods for treatment of the human or animal body; diagnostic methods \nWith regard to methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, or \ndiagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body, it should be noted that \nproducts, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods, are not \nexcluded from patentability, provided that the use of the product for any such method is not \n\n\n \n24 \ncomprised in the state of the art. It should be noted that a claim in the form \"Use of a \nsubstance or composition X for the manufacture of a medicament for therapeutic application \nZ\" may be allowable for either a first or \"subsequent\" such application. \n \nEven if a claim is drafted as a method of medical treatment and is for this reason not \ndirected to patentable subject-matter, a meaningful search may be possible if the \ndetermining technical feature is the effect of the substance, which can be searched. If, \nhowever, specific method features are present (e.g. dosing instructions for the user, \ncombination of pharmaceutical with physical treatment), a meaningful search may not be \npossible. In cases of doubt the Examiner should carry out the search to the extent that this \nis possible in the available documentation. \nHowever, regardless of whether such claims are searched or not, the applicant’s attention \nshould be drawn on the search opinion (if applicable, to the exclusion of such subject matter \nfrom industrial application. \n \n5.12  \nNo meaningful search possible \nA limitation of the search may also result from the application not meeting the relevant \nrequirements of the Act to such an extent that a meaningful search of the claims, or of some \nof the claims, or of part of a claim, is impossible. In such cases, the Examiner should make a \nmeaningful search to the extent that this is possible. What is or is not \"meaningful\" is a \nquestion of fact for the Examiner to determine. The exercise of the discretion of the \nExaminer will depend upon the facts of the case. There are clearly cases where a search is \nrendered de facto impossible by the failure to meet the prescribed requirements of the Act. \nBut these are not the only circumstances under which Rule 45 may be invoked. The word \n\"meaningful\" should be construed reasonably. \n \nOn the one hand, the word \"meaningful\" should not be construed in such a way that it is \ninvoked simply because a search is difficult. On the other hand, it may be the case that a \ngiven claim could, theoretically, be searched completely, but that nevertheless, the Examiner \ncomes to the conclusion, under a proper consideration of the relevant provisions of the Act, \nthat it would not be meaningful to do so, in the sense that it would not serve any useful \npurpose to do so having regard, for example, to any possible future prosecution of the \napplication. \n \nIn other cases, it may be that the results of the search themselves would be quite \nmeaningless. A number of non-limiting examples illustrated below: \n(i) Claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure \nOne example would be the case of a broad or speculative claim supported by only a limited \ndisclosure covering a small part of the scope of the claim. If the broadness of the claim is \nsuch as to render a meaningful search over the whole of the claim impossible, the Examiner \nwill carry out the search on the basis of the narrower, disclosed invention. This may mean a \nsearch of the specific examples. In such a case, it will often be de facto impossible to do a \ncomplete search of the whole of the claim at all, because of the broad drafting style. In other \ncases, a search of the whole of the claim would serve no useful purpose, as the claim would \nnot be defensible in any subsequent examination phase. Accordingly, the search will be \nlimited. Here, the requirements underlying the limitation would be those of sufficiency of \ndisclosure and support set out in section 34(5) and section 53(2). \n \n(ii) Claims lacking conciseness \nAn example would be where there are so many claims, or so many possibilities within a \nclaim, that it becomes unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection is \n\n\n \n25 \nsought. A complete search (or any search at all) may de facto be impossible, or alternatively \nmay serve no useful purpose as the claim or claim set would be indefensible in any \nsubsequent examination phase. Again, a partial search or a declaration of no search at all \nmay be appropriate, on the grounds that the lack of conciseness of the claim(s) is such as to \nrender a meaningful search impossible. \n \n(iii) Claims lacking clarity \nAn example would be where the applicant's choice of parameter to define his invention \nrenders a meaningful comparison with the prior art impossible, perhaps because the prior art \nhas not employed the same parameter, or has employed no parameter at all. In such a case, \nthe parameter chosen by the applicant may lack clarity. It may be that the lack of clarity of \nthe parameter is such as to render a meaningful search of the claims or of a claim or of a \npart of a claim impossible, because the results of any search would be meaningless, the \nchoice of parameter rendering a sensible comparison of the claimed invention with the prior \nart impossible. If so, a partial search will be appropriate, the search possibly being restricted \nto the worked examples, as far as they can be understood, or to the way in which the \ndesired parameter is obtained. \n \nThese examples are not exhaustive. The basic principle is that there should be clarity and \nopenness both for the applicant and for third parties as to what has and what has not been \nsearched. Exceptionally, the Examiner may, at his own discretion, where he thinks it \nappropriate, ask the applicant informally for clarification before deciding whether or not to \nlimit the search in respect of some or all of the claims, or for part of a claim or issue a \ndeclaration replacing the search report. \n \nIf the deficiencies which rendered a meaningful search impossible are subsequently \ncorrected by amendment or if their existence is successfully refuted by the applicant during \nthe substantive phase of examination, then an additional search may be carried out in the \nexamination procedure. \n \n5.13  \nSearch report \nGeneral \nThe results of the search will be recorded in a search report. A number of different possible \nlimitations of the scope of the search report exist. These are: \n(i) where claims are deemed abandoned for non-payment of claims fees; \n(ii) a declaration replacing the search report \n(iii) a partial search report according; \n(iv) a partial  search report due to a finding of a lack of unity of invention. \n \nA search report must contain no matter, in particular no expressions of opinion, reasoning, \narguments or explanations, other than that required as in the search form. \n \nForm \nThe search report should be prepared by the examiner and should contains a main page to \nbe used for all searches for recording the important features of the search, such as: \n(i) the application number; \n(ii) the classification of the application; \n(iii) the fields searched; \n(iv) the relevant documents revealed by the search; and \n(v) the name of the examiner who executed the search, as well as supplemental sheet. \n\n\n \n26 \n \nSupplemental sheet is to be used for indicating approval or modifications of the title, the \nabstract as submitted by the applicant, and the figure to be published with the abstract. \nThe supplemental sheet is also to be completed where there are restrictions on the search, \ni.e. when claims incurring fees are not searched due to non-payment of claims fees, when \nunity of invention is lacking, or when a meaningful search is not possible such that the \nsearch report is a partial one or is completely replaced by a declaration that no meaningful \nsearch can be conducted. \n \nChapter VI: \n \nSubstantive Examination \n6.1 \nIntroduction \nThe Purpose of examination is to ensure that the application and the invention to which it \nrelates meet the requirements set out in the relevant sections of the Act and the \nRegulations. The prime task of the Examiner at this stage is to deal with the substantive \nrequirements however there he should ensure that formality requirement have been \ncomplied with. In the event that there are deficiencies of formal requirements the applicants \nshould be invited to remedy the deficiencies.  \n \nDuring substantive examination main areas of focus for the examiner include: \n(i) \nSufficiency of disclosure \n(ii) \nClaims supported by description (enabled) \n(iii) \nUnity invention \n(iv) \nNovelty  \n(v) \nInventive step \n(vi) \nIndustrial applicability \n(vii) \nMatters excluded from patentability \n(viii) \nMatters prejudicial to public order, morality, safety and environment \n6.2 \nSufficiency of disclosure \nA detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention must be given. Since \nthe application is addressed to the person skilled in the art, it is neither necessary nor \ndesirable that details of well-known ancillary features should be given, but the description \nmust disclose any feature essential for carrying out the invention in sufficient detail to render \nit apparent to the skilled person how to put the invention into practice. A single example may \nsuffice, but where the claims cover a broad field, the application should not usually be \nregarded as satisfying the requirements of section 34(5) unless the description gives a \nnumber of examples or describes alternative embodiments or variations extending over the \narea protected by the claims.  \n \nThere are some instances where even a very broad field is sufficiently exemplified by a \nlimited number of examples or even one example. In these latter cases the application must \ncontain, in addition to the examples, sufficient information to allow the person skilled in the \nart, using his common general knowledge, to perform the invention over the whole area \nclaimed without undue burden and without needing inventive skill. If the Examiner is able to \nmake out a reasoned case that the application lacks sufficient disclosure, the onus of \nestablishing that the invention may be performed and repeated over substantially the whole \nof the claimed range lies with the applicant. it is necessary that the invention is described \nnot only in terms of its structure but also in terms of its function, unless the functions of the \nvarious parts are immediately apparent. Indeed in some technical fields (e.g. computers), a \nclear description of function may be much more appropriate than an over-detailed \ndescription of structure. \n \n\n\n \n27 \nIt is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that he supplies, on filing his application, a \nsufficient disclosure, i.e. one that meets the requirements of Section 34(5) in respect of the \ninvention as claimed in all of the claims. If the claims define the invention, or a feature \nthereof, in terms of parameters, the application as filed must include a clear description of \nthe methods used to determine the parameter values, unless a person skilled in the art \nwould know what method to use or unless all methods would yield the same result. If the \ndisclosure is seriously insufficient, such a deficiency cannot be cured subsequently by adding \nfurther examples or features without offending against Section 36(1), which requires that \namendments may not result in the introduction of subject-matter which extends beyond the \ncontent of the application as filed. Therefore, in such circumstances, the application must \nnormally be refused. If, however, the deficiency arises only in respect of some embodiments \nof the invention and not others, it could be remedied by restricting the claims to correspond \nto the sufficiently described embodiments only, the description of the remaining \nembodiments being deleted. \n6.3 \nInsufficient disclosure \n \nOccasionally applications are filed in which there is a fundamental insufficiency in the \ninvention in the sense that it cannot be carried out by a person skilled in the art; there is \nthen a failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 34(5) which is essentially irreparable. \nTwo instances deserve special mention. The first is where the successful performance of the \ninvention is dependent on chance. That is to say, the skilled person, in following the \ninstructions for carrying out the invention, finds either that the alleged results of the \ninvention are unrepeatable or that success in obtaining these results is achieved in a totally \nunreliable way. An example where this may arise is a microbiological process involving \nmutations. Such a case should be distinguished from one where repeated success is assured \neven though accompanied by a proportion of failures, as can arise e.g. in the manufacture of \nsmall magnetic cores or electronic components. In this latter case, provided the satisfactory \nparts can be readily sorted by a non-destructive testing procedure, no objection arises under \nSection 34(5). The second instance is where successful performance of the invention is \ninherently impossible because it would be contrary to well-established physical laws – this \napplies e.g. to a perpetual motion machine. If the claims for such a machine are directed to \nits function, and not merely to its structure, an objection arises not only under Section 34(5) \nbut also under section 25 in that the invention is not industrially applicable. \n6.4 \nIndustrial application \nThe description should indicate explicitly the way in which the invention is capable of \nexploitation in industry, if this is not obvious from the description or from the nature of the \ninvention. it is to be expected that, in most cases, the way in which the invention can be \nexploited in industry will be self-evident, so that no more explicit description on this point will \nbe required; but there may be a few instances, e.g. in relation to methods of testing, where \nthe manner of industrial exploitation is not apparent and must therefore be explicitly \nindicated. \nAlso, in relation to certain biotechnological inventions, i.e. sequences and partial sequences \nof genes, the industrial application is not self-evident. \nThe industrial application of such sequences must be disclosed in the patent application. \n6.5 \nManner and order of presentation \nThe manner and order of presentation of the description should be that specified in \nRegulation 13(2) unless, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a \ndifferent order would afford a better understanding and a more economic presentation.  \n \nSince the responsibility for clearly and completely describing the invention lies with the \napplicant, the examiner should not object to the presentation unless satisfied that such an \n\n\n \n28 \nobjection would be a proper exercise of his discretion. Some departure from the \nrequirements of Regulation 13(2) is acceptable, provided the description is clear and orderly \nand all the requisite information is present. Certain technically simple inventions may be fully \ncomprehensible with the minimum of description and only slight reference to prior art. \n6.6 \nTerminology \nAlthough the description should be clear and straightforward with avoidance of unnecessary \ntechnical jargon, the use of recognised terms of art is acceptable, and will often be desirable. \nLittle-known or specially formulated technical terms may be allowed provided that they are \nadequately defined and that there is no generally recognised equivalent. \n \nThis discretion may be extended to foreign terms when there is no equivalent in the \nlanguage of the proceedings. Terms already having an established meaning should not be \nallowed to be used to mean something different if this is likely to cause confusion. There \nmay, however, be circumstances where a term may legitimately be borrowed from an \nanalogous Art. Terminology and signs must be consistent throughout the application. \n6.7 \nComputer programs \nIn the particular case of inventions in the computer field, program listings in programming \nlanguages cannot be relied on as the sole disclosure of the invention. The description, as in \nother technical fields, should be written substantially in normal language, possibly \naccompanied by flow diagrams or other aids to understanding, so that the invention may be \nunderstood by those skilled in the art who are deemed not to be programming specialists. \nShort excerpts from programs written in commonly used programming languages can be \naccepted if they serve to illustrate an embodiment of the invention. \n6.8 \nPhysical values, units \nWhen the properties of a material are referred to, the relevant units should be specified if \nquantitative considerations are involved. If this is done by reference to a published standard \n(e.g. a standard of sieve sizes) and such standard is referred to by a set of initials or similar \nabbreviation, it should be adequately identified in the description.  \n \nPhysical values must be expressed in the units recognised in international practice, which is \ngenerally in the metric system, using SI units. Any values not meeting this requirement must \nalso be expressed in the units recognised in international practice (Regulation 17(20). Values \nin the inch/pound system, in general, do not meet the criterion \"recognised in international \npractice\". \n \nFor mathematical formulae the symbols in general use must be employed. For chemical \nformulae, the symbols, atomic weights and molecular formulae in general use must be \nemployed. In general, use should be made of the technical terms, signs and symbols \ngenerally accepted in the field in question. \n6.9 \nProper names, trademarks and trade names \nThe use of proper names, trademarks or trade names or similar words to refer to materials \nor articles is undesirable insofar as such words merely denote origin or where they may \nrelate to a range of different products. If such a word is used, then, where it is necessary in \norder to satisfy the requirements of Section 34(5), the product must be sufficiently identified, \nwithout reliance upon the word, to enable the invention to be carried out by the skilled \nperson at the date of filing. However, where such words have become internationally \naccepted as standard descriptive terms and have acquired a precise meaning (e.g. \"Bowden\" \ncable, \"Belleville\" washer, \"Panhard\" rod, \"teflon\" layer, \"caterpillar\" belt) they may be \nallowed without further identification of the product to which they relate. \n\n\n \n29 \n6.10 Registered trademarks \nIt is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that registered trademarks are acknowledged as \nsuch in the description. \n6.11 Reference documents \nReferences to other documents may relate either to the background art or to part of the \ndisclosure of the invention. Where the reference document relates to the background art, it \nmay be in the application as originally filed or introduced at a later date. \n  \nWhere the reference document relates directly to the disclosure of the invention (e.g. details \nof one of the components of a claimed apparatus), then the examiner should first consider \nwhether knowing what is in the reference document is in fact essential for carrying out the \ninvention as meant by Section 34(5): If not essential, the usual expression \"which is hereby \nincorporated by reference\", or any expression of the same kind, should be deleted from the \ndescription. \n \nIf matter in the document referred to is essential to satisfy the requirements of Section \n34(5), the examiner should require the deletion of the above-mentioned expression and that, \ninstead, the matter is expressly incorporated into the description, because the patent \nspecification should, regarding the essential features of the invention, be self-contained, i.e. \ncapable of being understood without reference to any other document. \n6.12 Drawings \n6.12.1  \nForm and content \nThe requirements relating to the form and content of drawings are set down in Regulation \n15. The only question likely to cause difficulty is whether the textual matter included on the \ndrawings is absolutely indispensable. In the case of circuit diagrams, block schematics and \nflow sheets, identifying catchwords for functional integers of complex systems (e.g. \n\"magnetic core store\", \"speed integrator\") may be regarded as indispensable from a practical \npoint of view if they are necessary to enable a diagram to be interpreted rapidly and clearly. \n6.12.2  \nPrinting quality \nThe examiner has also to check whether the drawings are suitable for reproduction.  \n6.12.3  \nPhotographs \nThe Act makes no express provision for photographs. They are nevertheless allowed where it \nis impossible to present in a drawing what is to be shown and provided that they are in black \nand white, directly reproducible and fulfil the applicable requirements for drawings (e.g. \npaper size, margins, etc.). Colour photographs are not accepted.  \n6.13 Inventions relating to biological material \n6.13.1  \nBiological material \nApplications relating to biological material are subject to the special provisions set out in \nRegulation 11. The term \"self-replicable matter\" means any material containing genetic \ninformation and capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system. If \nan invention involves the use of or concerns biological material which is not available to the \npublic and which cannot be described in the patent application in such a manner as to \nenable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, the disclosure is not \nconsidered to have satisfied the requirements of Section 34(5) unless the requirements of \nRegulation 11 have been met. \n\n\n \n30 \n6.13.2  \nPublic availability of biological material \nThe examiner must form an opinion as to whether or not the biological material is available \nto the public. There are several possibilities. The biological material may be known to be \nreadily available to those skilled in the art, e.g. baker's yeast or Bacillus natto, which is \ncommercially available, it may be a standard preserved strain, or other biological material \nwhich the examiner knows to have been preserved in a recognised depository and to be \navailable to the public. Alternatively, the applicant may have given in the description \nsufficient information as to the identifying characteristics of the biological material and as to \nthe prior availability in a depositary institution recognised for the purposes of Regulation 11 \nto satisfy the examiner. In any of these cases no further action is called for. If, however, the \napplicant has given no or insufficient information on public availability and the biological \nmaterial is a particular strain not falling within the known categories such as those already \nmentioned, then the examiner must assume that the biological material is not available to \nthe public. He must also examine whether the biological material could be described in the \npatent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person \nskilled in the art. \n6.13.4  \nDeposit of biological material \nIf the biological material is not available to the public and if it cannot be described in the \napplication in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled \nin the art, the examiner must check: \n(i) whether the application as filed gives such relevant information as is available to the \napplicant on the characteristics of the biological material. The relevant information under this \nprovision concerns the classification of the biological material and significant differences from \nknown biological material. For this purpose, the applicant must, to the extent available to \nhim, indicate morphological and biochemical characteristics and the proposed taxonomic \ndescription. \n \nThe information on the biological material in question which is generally known to the skilled \nperson on the date of filing is as a rule presumed to be available to the applicant and must \ntherefore be provided by him. If necessary, it has to be provided through experiments in \naccordance with the relevant standard literature.  \n \nAgainst this background, information should then be given on every further specific \nmorphological or physiological characteristic relevant for recognition and propagation of the \nbiological material, e.g. suitable media (composition of ingredients), in particular where the \nlatter are modified. \n \nAbbreviations for biological material or media are often less well known than the applicant \nassumes and should therefore be avoided or written in full at least once. \n \nIf biological material is deposited that cannot replicate itself but must be replicated in a \nbiological system (e.g. viruses, bacteriophages, plasmids, vectors or free DNA or RNA), the \nabove-mentioned information is also required for such biological system. If, for example, \nother biological material is required, such as host cells or helper viruses, that cannot be \nsufficiently described or is not available to the public, this material must also be deposited \nand characterised accordingly. In addition, the process for producing the biological material \nwithin this biological system must be indicated. \n \nIn many cases the above required information will already have been given to the depositary \ninstitution. \n \n\n\n \n31 \n6.14 Claims \n(section 34 (6)) \nThe application must contain \"one or more claims\". The claims must: \n(i) \"define the matter for which protection is sought\"; \n(ii) \"be clear and concise\"; and \n(iii) \"be supported by the description\". \n \nSince the extent of the protection conferred by a patent or application is determined by the \nterms of the claims (interpreted with the help of the description and the drawings), clarity of \nclaim is of the utmost importance. \n \n6.14 Form and content of claims \na) \nTechnical features \nThe claims must be drafted in terms of the \"technical features of the invention\". This means \nthat claims should not contain any statements relating, for example, to commercial \nadvantages or other non-technical matters, but statements of purpose should be allowed if \nthey assist in defining the invention. It is not necessary that every feature should be \nexpressed in terms of a structural limitation.  Functional features may be included provided \nthat a skilled person would have no difficulty in providing some means of performing this \nfunction without exercising inventive skill. Claims to the use of the invention, in the sense of \nthe technical application thereof, are allowable. \nb) \nTwo-part form \nRegulation 14(2) and (3) define the two-part form which a claim should have. The first part \nshould contain a statement indicating \"the designation of the subject-matter of the \ninvention\" i.e. the general technical class of apparatus, process, etc. to which the invention \nrelates, followed by a statement of \"those technical features which are necessary for the \ndefinition of the claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art\". \nThis statement of prior-art features is applicable only to independent claims and not to \ndependent claims.   \n \nIt is clear from the wording of Regulation 14 that it is necessary only to refer to those prior- \nart features which are relevant to the invention. For example, if the invention relates to a \nphotographic camera but the inventive step relates entirely to the shutter, it would be \nsufficient for the first part of the claim to read: \"A photographic camera including a focal \nplane shutter\" and there is no need to refer also to the other known features of a camera \nsuch as the lens and view-finder. The second part or \"characterising portion\" should state \nthe features which the invention adds to the prior art, i.e. the technical features for which, in \ncombination with the features stated in sub-paragraph (a) (the first part), protection is \nsought. \n \nIf a single document in the state of the art cited in the search report, reveals that one or \nmore features in the second part of the claim were already known in combination with all the \nfeatures in the first part of the claim and in that combination have the same effect as they \nhave in the full combination according to the invention, the examiner should require that \nsuch feature or features be transferred to the first part. Where, however, a claim relates to a \nnovel combination, and where the division of the features of the claim between the prior-art \npart and the characterising part could be made in more than one way without inaccuracy, \nthe applicant should not be pressed, unless there are very substantial reasons, to adopt a \ndifferent division of the features from that which he has chosen, if his version is not \nincorrect. \n \n\n\n \n32 \nc) \nFormulae and tables \nThe claims, as well as the description, may contain chemical or mathematical formulae but \nnot drawings.  \n \n6.15 Kinds of claim \na) \nCategories \nThe Act refers to different \"categories\" of claim (products, process or new use). For many \ninventions, claims in more than one category are needed for full protection. In fact, there are \nonly two basic kinds of claim, viz. claims to a physical entity (product, apparatus) and claims \nto an activity (process, use). The first basic kind of claim (\"product claim\") includes a \nsubstance or compositions (e.g. chemical compound or a mixture of compounds) as well as \nany physical entity (e.g. object, article, apparatus, machine, or system of co-operating \napparatus) which is produced by a person's technical skill. Examples are: \"a steering \nmechanism incorporating an automatic feed-back circuit ...\"; \"a woven garment comprising \n...\"; \"an insecticide consisting of X, Y, Z\"; or \"a communication system comprising a plurality \nof transmitting and receiving stations\".  \n \nThe second basic kind of claim (\"process claim\") is applicable to all kinds of activities in \nwhich the use of some material product for effecting the process is implied; the activity may \nbe exercised upon material products, upon energy, upon other processes (as in control \nprocesses) or upon living things. \n \nb) \nNumber of independent claims \nThe number of independent claims is not limited but the independent claims must relate to a \nsingle product or a single process. \n \nThe following are examples of typical situations falling within the scope of the exceptions \nfrom the principle of one independent claim per category: \n(i) \nexamples of a plurality of inter-related products  \n– plug and socket; \n– transmitter – receiver; \n– intermediate(s) and final chemical product; \n– gene – gene construct – host – protein – medicament; \n(ii) \nexample of a plurality of different inventive uses of a product or device: \n– second or further medical uses in the claim format of a \"second medical use\"-\ntype claim; \n(iii) \nexamples of alternative solutions to a particular problem: \n– a group of chemical compounds; \n– two or more processes for the manufacture of such compounds. \n \nc) \nIndependent and dependent claims \nAll applications will contain one or more independent claims directed to the essential features \nof the invention. Any such claim may be followed by one or more claims concerning \nparticular embodiments of that invention. It is evident that any claim relating to a particular \nembodiment must effectively include also the essential features of the invention, and hence \nmust include all the features of at least one independent claim. The term \"particular \nembodiment\" should be construed broadly as meaning any more specific disclosure of the \ninvention than that set out in the independent claim or claims. \n \n\n\n \n33 \nAny claim which includes all the features of any other claim is termed a \"dependent claim\". \nSuch a claim must contain, if possible at the beginning, a reference to the other claim, all \nfeatures of which it includes. Since a dependent claim does not by itself define all the \ncharacterising features of the subject-matter which it claims, expressions such as \n\"characterised in that\" or \"characterised by\" are not necessary in such a claim but are \nnevertheless permissible. A claim defining further particulars of an invention may include all \nthe features of another dependent claim and should then refer back to that claim. Also, in \nsome cases, a dependent claim may define a particular feature or features which may \nappropriately be added to more than one previous claim (independent or dependent). It \nfollows that there are several possibilities: a dependent claim may refer back to one or more \nindependent claims, to one or more dependent claims, or to both independent and \ndependent claims. \nd) \nArrangement of claims \nAll dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim and those referring back to \nseveral previous claims must be grouped together to the extent and in the most appropriate \nway possible. The arrangement must therefore be one which enables the association of \nrelated claims to be readily determined and their meaning in association to be readily \nconstrued. The examiner should object if the arrangement of claims is such as to create \nobscurity in the definition of the subject-matter to be protected. In general, however, when \nthe corresponding independent claim is allowable, the examiner should not concern himself \nunduly with the subject-matter of dependent claims, provided he is satisfied that they are \ntruly dependent and thus in no way extend the scope of protection of the invention defined \nin the corresponding independent claim. \n \ne) \nSubject-matter of a dependent claim \nIf the two-part form is used for the independent claim(s), dependent claims may relate to \nfurther details of features not only of the characterising portion but also of the preamble. \n \nf) \nAlternatives in a claim \nA claim, whether independent or dependent, may refer to alternatives, provided that the \nnumber and presentation of alternatives in a single claim does not make the claim obscure \nor difficult to construe and provided that the claim meets the requirements of unity. In case \nof a claim defining (chemical or non-chemical) alternatives, i.e. a so-called \"Markush-\ngrouping\", unity of invention should be considered to be present if the alternatives are of a \nsimilar nature and can fairly be substituted for one another. \n \ng) \nIndependent claims containing a reference to another claim \nA claim may also contain a reference to another claim even if it is not a dependent claim. \nOne example of this is a claim referring to a claim of a different category (e.g. \"Apparatus \nfor carrying out the process of claim 1 ...\", or \"Process for the manufacture of the product of \nclaim 1 ...\"). Similarly, in a situation like the plug and socket example above , a claim to the \none part referring to the other co-operating part (e.g. \"plug for co-operation with the socket \nof claim 1 ...\") is not a dependent claim. In all these examples, the examiner should carefully \nconsider the extent to which the claim containing the reference necessarily involves the \nfeatures of the claim referred to and the extent to which it does not. \n \nIn the case of a claim for a process which results in the product of a product claim, if the \nproduct claim is patentable then no separate examination for the novelty and non-\nobviousness of the process claim is necessary, provided that all features of the product as \n\n\n \n34 \ndefined in the product claim inevitably result from the claimed process. This also applies in \nthe case of a claim for the use of a product, when the product is patentable and is used with \nits features as claimed. In all other instances, the patentability of the claim referred to does \nnot necessarily imply the patentability of the independent claim containing the reference. It \nshould also be noted that if the process, product and/or use claims have different effective \ndates, a separate examination may still be necessary in view of intermediate documents. \n \n6.16 Clarity and interpretation of claims \na) \nClarity \nThe requirement that the claims must be clear applies to individual claims and also to the \nclaims as a whole. The clarity of the claims is of the utmost importance in view of their \nfunction in defining the matter for which protection is sought. Therefore, the meaning of the \nterms of a claim should, as far as possible, be clear for the person skilled in the art from the \nwording of the claim alone. In view of the differences in the scope of protection which may \nbe attached to the various categories of claims, the examiner should ensure that the wording \nof a claim leaves no doubt as to its category. \n \nb) \nInterpretation \nEach claim should be read giving the words the meaning and scope which they normally \nhave in the relevant art, unless in particular cases the description gives the words a special \nmeaning, by explicit definition or otherwise. Moreover, if such a special meaning applies, the \nexaminer should, so far as possible, require the claim to be amended whereby the meaning \nis clear from the wording of the claim alone.  The claim should also be read with an attempt \nto make technical sense out of it. Such a reading may involve a departure from the strict \nliteral meaning of the wording of the claims. \nc) \nInconsistencies \nAny inconsistency between the description and the claims should be avoided if it may throw \ndoubt on the extent of protection and therefore render the claim unclear or unsupported or \nalternatively, render the claim objectionable. Such inconsistency can be of the following \nkinds: \n(i) Simple verbal inconsistency \nFor example, there is a statement in the description which suggests that the invention is \nlimited to a particular feature but the claims are not thus limited; also, the description places \nno particular emphasis on this feature and there is no reason for believing that the feature is \nessential for the performance of the invention. In such a case, the inconsistency can be \nremoved either by broadening the description or by limiting the claims. \nSimilarly, if the claims are more limited than the description, the claims may be broadened or \nthe description may be limited. \n(ii) Inconsistency regarding apparently essential features \nFor example, it may appear, either from general technical knowledge or from what is stated \nor implied in the description, that a certain described technical feature not mentioned in an \nindependent claim is essential to the performance of the invention, or, in other words, is \nnecessary for the solution of the problem to which the invention relates. The examiner may \ndraw the attention of the applicant to the inconsistency. If, in response, the applicant shows \nconvincingly, e.g. by means of additional documents or other evidence, that the feature is in \nfact not essential, he may be allowed to retain the unamended claim and, where necessary, \nto amend the description instead. The opposite situation in which an independent claim \n\n\n \n35 \nincludes features which do not seem essential for the performance of the invention is not \nobjectionable. This is a matter of the applicant's choice. The examiner should therefore not \nsuggest that a claim be broadened by the omission of apparently inessential features; \n(iii) part of the subject-matter of the description and/or drawings is not covered \nby the claims \nFor example, the claims all specify an electric circuit employing semiconductor devices but \none of the embodiments in the description and drawings employs electronic tubes instead. In \nsuch a case, the inconsistency can normally be removed either by broadening the claims \n(assuming that the description and drawings as a whole provide adequate support for such \nbroadening) or by removing the \"excess\" subject-matter from the description and drawings. \nHowever, if examples in the description and/or drawings which are not covered by the claims \nare presented not as embodiments of the invention but as background art or examples which \nare useful for understanding the invention, the retention of these examples may be allowed. \n \nd) \nGeneral statements, \"spirit\" of invention \nGeneral statements in the description which imply that the extent of protection may be \nexpanded in some vague and not precisely defined way should be objected to. In particular, \nobjection should be raised to any statement which refers to the extent of protection being \nexpanded to cover the \"spirit\" of the invention. Objection should likewise be raised, in the \ncase where the claims are directed to a combination of features, to any statement which \nseems to imply that protection is nevertheless sought not only for the combination as a \nwhole but also for individual features or sub-combinations thereof. \n \ne) \nEssential features \nAn independent claim should specify explicitly all of the essential features needed to define \nthe invention except insofar as such features are implied by the generic terms used, e.g. a \nclaim to a \"bicycle\" does not need to mention the presence of wheels. \nIf a claim is to a process for producing the product of the invention, then the process as \nclaimed should be one which, when carried out in a manner which would seem reasonable to \na person skilled in the art, necessarily has as its end result that particular product; otherwise \nthere is an internal inconsistency and therefore lack of clarity in the claim. \nIn the case of a product claim, if the product is of a well-known kind and the invention lies in \nmodifying it in certain respects, it is sufficient that the claim clearly identifies the product and \nspecifies what is modified and in what way. Similar considerations apply to claims for an \napparatus. Where patentability depends on a technical effect, the claims must be so drafted \nas to include all the technical features of the invention which are essential for the technical \neffect. \n \nf) \nRelative terms \nIt is preferable not to use a relative or similar term such as \"thin\", \"wide\" or \"strong\" in a \nclaim unless the term has a well-recognised meaning in the particular art, e.g. \"high-\nfrequency\" in relation to an amplifier, and this is the meaning intended. Where the term has \nno well-recognised meaning it should, if possible, be replaced by a more precise wording \nfound elsewhere in the original disclosure. Where there is no basis in the disclosure for a \nclear definition and the term is not essential having regard to the invention, it should \nnormally be retained in the claim, because to excise it would generally lead to an extension \nof the subject-matter beyond the content of the application as filed. However, an unclear \nterm cannot be allowed in a claim if the term is essential having regard to the invention. \n\n\n \n36 \nEqually, an unclear term cannot be used by the applicant to distinguish his invention from \nthe prior art.  \n \ng) \nTerms like \"about\" and \"approximately\" \nParticular attention is required whenever the word \"about\" or similar terms such as \n\"approximately\" are used. Such a word may be applied, for example, to a particular value \n(e.g. \"about 200C\") or to a range (e.g.\"about x to about y\"). In each case, the examiner \nshould use his judgment as to whether the meaning is sufficiently clear in the context of the \napplication read as a whole. However, the word can only be permitted if its presence does \nnot prevent the invention from being unambiguously distinguished from the prior art with \nrespect to novelty and inventive step. \n \nh) \nTrademarks \nThe use of trade marks and similar expressions in claims should not be allowed as it may not \nbe guaranteed that the product or feature referred to is not modified while maintaining its \nname during the term of the patent. They may be allowed exceptionally if their use is \nunavoidable and they are generally recognised as having a precise meaning. \n \ni) \nOptional features \nExpressions like \"preferably\", \"for example\", \"such as\" or \"more particularly\" should be \nlooked at carefully to ensure that they do not introduce ambiguity. Expressions of this kind \nhave no limiting effect on the scope of a claim; that is to say, the feature following any such \nexpression is to be regarded as entirely optional. \n \nj) \nResult to be achieved \nThe area defined by the claims must be as precise as the invention allows. As a general \nRegulation, claims which attempt to define the invention by a result to be achieved should \nnot be allowed, in particular if they only amount to claiming the underlying technical \nproblem. However, they may be allowed if the invention either can only be defined in such \nterms or \ncannot otherwise be defined more precisely without unduly restricting the scope of the \nclaims and if the result is one which can be directly and positively verified by tests or \nprocedures adequately specified in the description or known to the person skilled in the art \nand which do not require undue experimentation For example, the invention may relate to \nan ashtray in which a smouldering cigarette end will be automatically extinguished due to \nthe shape and relative dimensions of the ashtray. The latter may vary considerably in a \nmanner difficult to define whilst still providing the desired effect. So long as the claim \nspecifies the construction and shape of the ashtray as clearly as possible, it may define the \nrelative dimensions by reference to the result to be achieved, provided that the specification \nincludes adequate directions to enable the reader to determine the required dimensions by \nroutine test procedures. It should be noted that the above-mentioned requirements for \nallowing a definition of subject-matter in terms of a result to be achieved differ from those \nfor allowing a definition of subject-matter in terms of functional features. \n \n6.17 Parameters \nWhere the invention relates to a product, it may be defined in a claim in various ways, viz. \nas a chemical product by its chemical formula, as a product of a process (if no clearer \ndefinition is possible) or, exceptionally, by its parameters. Parameters are characteristic \n\n\n \n37 \nvalues, which may be values of directly measurable properties (e.g. the melting point of a \nsubstance, the flexural strength of steel, the resistance of an electrical conductor) or may be \ndefined as more or less complicated mathematical combinations of several variables in the \nform of formulae. Characterisation of a product mainly by its parameters should only be \nallowed in those cases where the invention cannot be adequately defined in any other way, \nprovided that those parameters can be clearly and reliably determined either by indications \nin the description or by objective procedures which are usual in the art. The same applies to \na process-related feature which is defined by parameters. Cases in which unusual \nparameters are employed or a non-accessible apparatus for measuring the parameter(s) is \nused are prima facie objectionable on grounds of lack of clarity, as no meaningful \ncomparison with the prior art can be made. Such cases might also disguise lack of novelty. \nWhether the method of and the means for measurement of the parameters need also be in \nthe claim. \n \n6.18 Product-by-process claim \nClaims for products defined in terms of a process of manufacture are allowable only if the \nproducts as such fulfil the requirements for patentability, i.e. inter alia that they are new and \ninventive. A product is not rendered novel merely by the fact that it is produced by means of \na new process. A claim defining a product in terms of a process is to be construed as a claim \nto the product as such. \n \nThe claim may for instance take the form \"Product X obtainable by process Y\". Irrespective \nof whether the term \"obtainable\", \"obtained\", \"directly obtained\" or an equivalent wording is \nused in the product-by process claim, it is still directed to the product per se and confers \nabsolute protection upon the product. \n \nIf the subject-matter of a patent is a process, the protection conferred by the patent extends \nto the products directly obtained by such process. The provisions of the Act are understood \nto apply to processes producing products completely different from the starting materials as \nwell as to the processes producing only superficial changes (e.g. painting, polishing). \n \n6.19 \"Apparatus for ...\", \"Method for ...\", etc. \nIf a claim commences with such words as: \"Apparatus for carrying out the process etc...\" \nthis must be construed as meaning merely apparatus suitable for carrying out the process. \nApparatus which otherwise possesses all of the features specified in the claims but which \nwould be unsuitable for the stated purpose or would require modification to enable it to be \nso used, should normally not be considered as anticipating the claim. \n \nSimilar considerations apply to a claim for a product for a particular use. For example, if a \nclaim refers to a \"mould for molten steel\", this implies certain limitations for the mould. \nTherefore, a plastic ice cube tray with a melting point much lower than that of steel would \nnot come within the claim. Similarly, a claim to a substance or composition for a particular \nuse should be construed as meaning a substance or composition which is in fact suitable for \nthe stated use; a known product which prima facie is the same as the substance or \ncomposition defined in the claim, but which is in a form which would render it unsuitable for \nthe stated use, would not deprive the claim of novelty. However, if the known product is in a \nform in which it is in fact suitable for the stated use, though it has never been described for \nthat use, it would deprive the claim of novelty. An exception to this general principle of \ninterpretation is where the claim is to a known substance or composition for use in a \nsurgical, therapeutic or diagnostic method. \n \n\n\n \n38 \nIn contrast to an apparatus or product claim, in case of a method claim commencing with \nsuch words as: \"Method for remelting galvanic layers\" the part \"for remelting ...\" should not \nbe understood as meaning that the process is merely suitable for remelting galvanic layers, \nbut rather as a functional feature concerning the remelting of galvanic layers and, hence, \ndefining one of the method steps of the claimed method  \n \n6.20 Definition by reference to use or another entity \nWhere a claim in respect of a physical entity (product, apparatus) seeks to define the \ninvention by reference to features relating to the entity's use, a lack of clarity can result. This \nis particularly the case where the claim not only defines the entity itself but also specifies its \nrelationship to a second entity which is not part of the claimed entity (for example, a cylinder \nhead for an engine, where the former is defined by features of its location in the latter). \nBefore considering a restriction to the combination of the two entities, if should always be \nremembered that the applicant is normally entitled to independent protection of the first \nentity per se, even if it was initially defined by its relationship to the second entity.  \n \nSince the first entity can often be produced and marketed independently of the second \nentity, it will usually be possible to obtain independent protection by wording the claims \nappropriately (for example, by substituting \"connectable\" for \"connected\"). If it is not \npossible to give a clear definition of the first entity per se, then the claim should be directed \nto a combination of the first and second entities (for example, \"engine with a cylinder head\" \nor \"engine comprising a cylinder head\"). \n \nIt may also be allowable to define the dimensions and/or shape of a first entity in an \nindependent claim by general reference to the dimensions and/or corresponding shape of a \nsecond entity which is not part of the claimed first entity but is related to it through use. This \nparticularly applies where the size of the second entity is in some way standardized (for \nexample, in the case of a mounting bracket for a vehicle number plate, where the bracket \nframe and fixing elements are defined in relation to the outer shape of the number-plate). \nHowever, references to second entities which cannot be seen as subject to standardization \nmay also be sufficiently clear in cases where the skilled person would have little difficulty in \ninferring the resultant restriction of the scope of protection for the first entity (for example, \nin the case of a covering sheet for an agricultural round bale, where the length and breadth \nof the covering sheet and how it is folded are defined by reference to the bale's \ncircumference, width and diameter. \n \nIt is neither necessary for such claims to contain the exact dimensions of the second entity, \nnor do they have to refer to a combination of the first and second entities. Specifying the \nlength, width and/or height of the first entity without reference to the second would lead to \nan unwarranted restriction of the scope of protection. \n \n6.21 The expression \"in\" \nTo avoid ambiguity, particular care should be exercised when assessing claims which employ \nthe word \"in\" to define a relationship between different physical entities (product, \napparatus), or between entities and activities (process, use), or between different activities. \nExamples of claims worded in this way include the following: \n(i) \nCylinder head in a four-stroke engine; \n(ii) \nIn a telephone apparatus with an automatic dialler, dial tone detector and feature \ncontroller, the dial tone detector comprising...; \n(iii) \nIn a process using an electrode feeding means of an arc-welding apparatus, a \nmethod for controlling the arc welding current and voltage comprising the \nfollowing steps: ...; and \n\n\n \n39 \n(iv) \nIn a process/system/apparatus etc. ... the improvement consisting of... \n \nIn examples (i) to (iii) the emphasis is on the fully functioning sub-units (cylinder head, dial \ntone detector, method for controlling the arc welding current and voltage) rather than the \ncomplete unit within which the subunit is contained (four-stroke engine, telephone, process).  \n \nThis can make it unclear whether the protection sought is limited to the sub-unit per se, or \nwhether the unit as a whole is to be protected. For the sake of clarity, claims of this kind \nshould be directed either to \"a unit with (or comprising) a sub-unit\" (e.g. \"four-stroke engine \nwith a cylinder head\"), or to the subunit per se, specifying its purpose (for example, \"cylinder \nhead for a four stroke engine\"). With claims of the type indicated by example (iv), the use of \nthe word \"in\" sometimes makes it unclear whether protection is sought for the improvement \nonly or for all the features defined in the claim. Here, too, it is essential to ensure that the \nwording is clear. \n \nHowever, claims such as \"use of a substance ... as an anticorrosive ingredient in a paint or \nlacquer composition\" are acceptable on the basis of second non-medical use  \n \n6.22 Use claims \nFor the purposes of examination, a \"use\" claim in a form such as \"the use of substance X as \nan insecticide\" should be regarded as equivalent to a \"process\" claim of the form \"a process \nof killing insects using substance X\". Thus a claim in the form indicated should not be \ninterpreted as directed to the substance X recognisable (e.g. by further additives) as \nintended for use as an insecticide.  \n \nSimilarly, a claim for \"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit\" would be equivalent to \na process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the transistor and \nshould not be interpreted as being directed to \"an amplifying circuit in which the transistor is \nused\", nor to \"the process of using the transistor in building such a circuit\". \n \n6.23 References to the description or drawings \nThe claims must not, in respect of the technical features of the invention, rely on references \nto the description or drawings \"except where absolutely necessary\". In particular they must \nnot normally rely on such references as \"as described in part ... of the description\", or \"as \nillustrated in Figure 2 of the drawings\". The emphatic wording of the excepting clause should \nbe noted. The onus is upon the applicant to show that it is \"absolutely necessary\" to rely on \nreference to the description or drawings in appropriate cases. An example of an allowable \nexception would be that in which the invention involves some peculiar shape, illustrated in \nthe drawings, but which cannot be readily defined either in words or by a simple \nmathematical formula.  \n \n6.24 Method of and means for measuring parameters referred to in claims \n \nA further special case is where the invention is characterised by parameters. Provided that \nthe conditions for defining the invention in this way are met, the definition of the invention \nshould appear completely in the claim itself whenever this is reasonably practicable. In \nprinciple the method of measurement is necessary for the unambiguous definition of the \nparameter. The method of and means for measurement of the parameter values need not \nhowever be in the claims when: \n\n\n \n40 \n(i) \nthe description of the method is so long that its inclusion would make the claim \nunclear through lack of conciseness or difficult to understand; in that case the \nclaim should include a reference to the description; \n(ii) \na person skilled in the art would know which method to employ, e.g. because \nthere is only one method, or because a particular method is commonly used; or \n(iii) \nall known methods yield the same result (within the limits of measurement \naccuracy). \n \nHowever, in all other cases the method of and means for measurement should be included in \nthe claims as the claims define the matter for which protection is sought. \n \n6.25 Reference signs \n \nIf the application contains drawings, and the comprehension of the claims would be \nimproved by establishing the connection between the features mentioned in the claims and \nthe corresponding reference signs in the drawings, then appropriate reference signs should \nbe placed in parentheses after the features mentioned in the claims. If there is a large \nnumber of different embodiments, only the reference signs of the most important \nembodiments need be incorporated in the independent claim(s). \n \nWhere claims are drafted in the two-part form set out in, the reference signs should be \ninserted not only in the characterising part but also in the preamble of the claims. Reference \nsigns should not however be seen as limiting the extent of the matter protected by the \nclaims; their sole function is to make claims easier to understand.  \nIf text is added to reference signs in parentheses in the claims, lack of clarity can arise. 84). \nExpressions such as \"securing means (screw 13, nail 14)\" or \"valve assembly (valve seat 23, \nvalve element 27, valve seat 28)\" are not reference signs but are special features, that are \nnot applicable. A lack of clarity can also arise with bracketed expressions that do not include \nreference signs, e.g. \"(concrete) moulded brick\".  \n \nIn contrast, bracketed expressions with a generally accepted meaning are allowable, e.g. \n\"(meth)acrylate\" which is known as an abbreviation for \"acrylate and methacrylate\". The use \nof brackets in chemical or mathematical formulae is also unobjectionable. \n \n6.26 Negative limitations (e.g. disclaimers) \n \nA claim's subject-matter is normally defined in terms of positive features indicating that \ncertain technical elements are present. Exceptionally, however, the subject-matter may be \nrestricted using a negative limitation expressly stating that particular features are absent. \nThis may be done e.g. to remove non-patentable embodiments disclosed in the application \nas filed or if the absence of a feature can be deduced from the application as filed. \n \nNegative limitations such as disclaimers may be used only if adding positive features to the \nclaim either would not define more clearly and concisely the subject-matter still protectable \nor would unduly limit the scope of the claim. \n \nOn the other hand, if a claim for a chemical compound refers to it as \"consisting of \ncomponents A, B and C\" by their proportions expressed in percentages, the presence of any \nadditional component is excluded and therefore the percentages should add up to 100%. \n \n \n\n\n \n41 \n6.27 Conciseness, number of claims \n \nThe requirement that the claims must be concise refers to the claims in their entirety as well \nas to the individual claims. The number of claims must be considered in relation to the \nnature of the invention the applicant seeks to protect. Undue repetition of wording, e.g. \nbetween one claim and another, should be avoided by the use of the dependent form.  \n \nAs for dependent claims, while there is no objection to a reasonable number of such claims \ndirected to particular preferred features of the invention, the examiner should object to a \nmultiplicity of claims of a trivial nature. What is or what is not a reasonable number of claims \ndepends on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  \n \nThe interests of the relevant public must also be borne in mind. The presentation of the \nclaims should not make it unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection \nis sought. Objection may also arise where there is a multiplicity of alternatives within a single \nclaim, if \nthis renders it unduly burdensome to determine the matter for which protection is sought. \n \n \n6.28 Support in Description \n6.28.1 General remarks \nThe claims must be supported by the description. This means that there must be a basis in \nthe description for the subject-matter of every claim and that the scope of the claims must \nnot be broader than is justified by the extent of the description and drawings and also the \ncontribution to the art.  \n \nMost claims are generalisations from one or more particular examples. The extent of \ngeneralisation permissible is a matter which the examiner must judge in each particular case \nin the light of the relevant prior art. \n \nThus an invention which opens up a whole new field is entitled to more generality in the \nclaims than one which is concerned with advances in a known technology. A fair statement \nof claim is one which is not so broad that it goes beyond the invention nor yet so narrow as \nto deprive the applicant of a just reward for the disclosure of his invention. The applicant \nshould be allowed to cover all obvious modifications of, equivalents to and uses of that which \nhe has described. In particular, if it is reasonable to predict that all the variants covered by \nthe claims have the properties or uses the applicant ascribes to them in the description, he \nshould be allowed to draw his claims accordingly.  \n \nAs a general rule, a claim should be regarded as supported by the description unless there \nare well-founded reasons for believing that the skilled person would be unable, on the basis \nof the information given in the application as filed, to extend the particular teaching of the \ndescription to the whole of the field claimed by using routine methods of experimentation or \nanalysis. Support must, however, be of a technical character; vague statements or assertions \nhaving no technical content provide no basis. \n \n \nThe examiner should raise an objection of lack of support only if he has well-founded \nreasons. Once the examiner has set out a reasoned case that, for example, a broad claim is \nnot supported over the whole of its breadth, the onus of demonstrating that the claim is fully \nsupported lies with the applicant.  \n \n\n\n \n42 \nWhere objection is raised, the reasons should, where possible, be supported specifically by a \npublished document. A claim in generic form, i.e. relating to a whole class, e.g. of materials \nor machines, may be acceptable even if of broad scope, if there is fair support in the \ndescription and there is no reason to suppose that the invention cannot be worked through \nthe whole of the field claimed. Where the information given appears insufficient to enable a \nperson skilled in the art to extend the teaching of the description to parts of the field claimed \nbut not explicitly described by using routine methods of experimentation or analysis, the \nexaminer should raise a reasoned objection, and invite the applicant to establish, by suitable \nresponse, that the invention can in fact be readily applied on the basis of the information \ngiven over the whole field claimed or, failing this, to restrict the claim accordingly. \n6.28.2 Lack of support vs. insufficient disclosure \nIt should be noted that, although an objection of lack of support is an objection, it can often, \nalso be considered as an objection of insufficient disclosure of the invention the objection \nbeing that the disclosure is insufficient to enable the skilled person to carry out the \n\"invention\" over the whole of the broad field claimed (although sufficient in respect of a \nnarrow \"invention\"). Both requirements are designed to reflect the principle that the terms of \na claim should be commensurate with, or be justified by, the invention.  \n \nWhether the objection is raised as lack of support or as insufficiency is unimportant in \nexamination proceedings; but it is important in opposition proceedings since there only the \nlatter ground is available. \n6.28.3 Support for dependent claims \nWhere certain subject-matter is clearly disclosed in a claim of the application as filed, but is \nnot mentioned anywhere in the description, it is permissible to amend the description so that \nit includes this subject-matter. Where the claim is dependent, it may suffice if it is mentioned \nin the description that the claim sets out a particular embodiment of the invention. \n \n \n6.29 Unity of invention \n6.29.1 General remarks \nA patent application must \"relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked \nas to form a single general inventive concept\". The second of these alternatives, i.e. the \nsingle-concept linked group, may give rise to a plurality of independent claims in the same \ncategory. \n \n6.29.2 Special technical features \nThe link between the inventions must be a technical relationship which finds expression in \nthe claims in terms of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression \n\"special technical features\" means, in any one claim, the particular technical feature or \nfeatures that define a contribution that the claimed invention considered as a whole makes \nover the prior art. Once the special technical features of each invention have been identified, \none must determine whether or not there is a technical relationship between the inventions \nand, furthermore, whether or not this relationship involves these special technical features. \nIt is not necessary that the special technical features in each invention be the same.  \n \n\n\n \n43 \n6.29.3 Intermediate and final products \nUnity of invention should be considered to be present in the context of intermediate and final \nproducts where: \n(i) the intermediate and final products have the same essential structural element, i.e. their \nbasic chemical structures are the same or their chemical structures are technically closely \ninterrelated, the intermediate incorporating an essential structural element into the final \nproduct, and \n(ii) the intermediate and final products are technically inter-related, i.e. the final product is \nmanufactured directly from the intermediate or is separated from it by a small number of \nintermediates all containing the same essential structural element. Unity of invention may \nalso be present between intermediate and final products of which the structures are not \nknown – for example, as between an intermediate having a known structure and a final \nproduct with unknown structure or as between an intermediate of unknown structure and a \nfinal product of unknown structure.  \n \nIn such cases, there should be sufficient evidence to lead one to conclude that the \nintermediate and final products are technically closely interrelated as, for example, when the \nintermediate contains the same essential element as the final product or incorporates an \nessential element into the final product. Different intermediate products used in different \nprocesses for the preparation of the final product may be claimed provided that they have \nthe same essential structural element. The intermediate and final products should not be \nseparated, in the process leading from one to the other, by an intermediate which is not \nnew. Where different intermediates for different structural parts of the final product are \nclaimed, unity should not be regarded as being present between the intermediates.  \n \nIf the intermediate and final products are families of compounds, each intermediate \ncompound should correspond to a compound claimed in the family of the final products. \nHowever, some of the final products may have no corresponding compound in the family of \nthe intermediate products, so the two families need not be absolutely congruent. The mere \nfact that, besides the ability to be used to produce final products, the intermediates also \nexhibit other possible effects or activities should not prejudice unity of invention. \n6.29.4 Markush grouping \nWhere a single claim defines (chemical or non-chemical) alternatives, i.e. a so-called \n\"Markush grouping\", unity of invention should be considered to be present if the alternatives \nare of a similar nature. When the Markush grouping is for alternatives of chemical \ncompounds, they should be regarded as being of a similar nature where: \n(i) \nall alternatives have a common property or activity; and \n(ii) \na common structure is present, i.e. a significant structural element is shared by all \nof the alternatives, or all alternatives belong to a recognised class of chemical \ncompounds in the art to which the invention pertains.  \n \nA \"significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives\" where the compounds \nshare a common chemical structure which occupies a large portion of their structures, or, in \ncase the compounds have in common only a small portion of their structures, the commonly \nshared structure constitutes a structurally distinctive portion in view of existing prior art. The \nstructural element may be a single component or a combination of individual components \nlinked together. The alternatives belong to a \"recognised class of chemical compounds\" if \nthere is an expectation from the knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave \nin the same way in the context of the claimed invention, i.e. that each member could be \nsubstituted one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be \nachieved. If it can be shown that at least one Markush alternative is not novel, unity of \ninvention should be reconsidered. \n\n\n \n44 \n6.29.5 Individual features in a claim \nObjection of lack of unity does not arise because of one claim containing a number of \nindividual features, where these features do not present a technical inter-relationship (i.e. a \ncombination), but merely a juxtaposition \n6.29.6 Dependent claims \nNo objection on account of lack of unity a is justified in respect of a dependent claim and the \nclaim on which it depends, on the ground that the general concept they have in common is \nthe subject-matter of the independent claim, which is also contained in the dependent claim. \nFor example, suppose claim 1 claims a turbine rotor blade shaped in a specified manner, \nwhile claim 2 is for a \"turbine rotor blade as claimed in claim 1 and produced from alloy Z\". \nThe common general concept linking the dependent with the independent claim is \"turbine \nrotor blade shaped in a specified manner\". \n \nIf, however, the independent claim appears not to be patentable, then the question whether \nthere is still an inventive link between all the claims dependent on that claim needs to be \ncarefully considered non-unity. It may be that the \"special technical features\" of one claim \ndependent on this non-patentable independent claim are not present in the same or \ncorresponding form in another claim dependent on that claim. \n \n6.30 Unity invention \nLack of unity during substantive examination \nThe final responsibility for establishing whether the application meets the requirement of \nunity of invention ultimately rests with the Examiner. The Examiner will normally initially \nuphold the position taken in the search opinion and will then require deletion of all the \ninventions other than that which has been searched. If the Examiner is convinced, e.g. by \narguments from the applicant, that the opinion on unity at the search stage was incorrect, \nthen an additional search is performed for that part of the subject-matter which is judged to \nbe unitary with an invention which was searched and the examination is carried out on those \nclaims which comply with the requirement of unity of invention. \n \nIf the applicant has taken the opportunity to have other inventions searched, then he may \ndetermine that the application is to proceed on the basis of any of these, the other(s) being \ndeleted. If the applicant has not yet done so, the examiner should at the beginning of \nsubstantive examination, if he maintains the objection of lack of unity, invite the applicant to \nstate on which invention the prosecution of the application should be based and to limit the \napplication accordingly by excising those parts belonging to the other inventions.  \n \nWhether or not the question of unity of invention has been raised by the Search Division, it \nmust always be considered by the Examiner. Whenever unity is found to be lacking, the \napplicant should be required to limit his claims in such a way as to overcome the objection. \nExcision or amendment of parts of the description may also be necessary. One or more \ndivisional applications, covering matter removed to meet this objection, may be filed. \n6.31 Novelty  \n6.31.1General remarks \nThe Act provides that an invention is new if it is not anticipated by prior art. Everything \nmade available to the public anywhere in, the world by means of written disclosure \n(including drawings and other illustrations) or, by oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other \nnon-written means shall be considered prior art provided that such disclosure occurred \n\n\n \n45 \nbefore the date of filing of the application or, if priority is claimed, before the priority date \nvalidly claimed in respect thereof. \n \nAn invention is considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.  It \nshould be noted that in considering novelty, it is not permissible to combine separate items \nof prior art together. It is also not permissible to combine separate items belonging to \ndifferent embodiments described in one and the same document, unless such combination \nhas specifically been suggested. However, if a document (the \"primary\" document) refers \nexplicitly to another document as providing more detailed information on certain features, \nthe teaching of the latter is to be regarded as incorporated into the document containing the \nreference, if the document referred to was available to the public on the publication date of \nthe document containing the reference. The relevant date for novelty purposes, however, is \nalways the date of the primary document. It is further permissible to use a dictionary or \nsimilar document of reference in order to interpret a special term used in a document. \n6.31.2 Implicit features or well-known equivalents \nA document takes away the novelty of any claimed subject-matter derivable directly and \nunambiguously from that document including any features implicit to a person skilled in the \nart in what is expressly mentioned in the document, e.g. a disclosure of the use of rubber in \ncircumstances where clearly its elastic properties are used even if this is not explicitly stated \ntakes away the novelty of the use of an elastic material. The limitation to subject-matter \n\"derivable directly and unambiguously\" from the document is important. Thus, when \nconsidering novelty, it is not correct to interpret the teaching of a document as embracing \nwell-known equivalents which are not disclosed in the documents; this is a matter of \nobviousness. \n6.31.3 Relevant date of a prior document \nIn determining novelty, a prior document should be read as it would have been read by a \nperson skilled in the art on the relevant date of the document. By \"relevant\" date is meant \nthe publication date in the case of a previously published document and the date of filing (or \npriority date, where appropriate) in the case of a document. \n6.31.4 Enabling disclosure of a prior document \nSubject-matter described in a document can only be regarded as having been made \navailable to the public, and therefore as comprised in the state if the information given \ntherein to the skilled person is sufficient to enable him, at the relevant date of the document, \nto practice the technical teaching which is the subject of the document, taking into account \nalso the general knowledge at that time in the field to be expected of him and not published. \nSimilarly, it should be noted that a chemical compound, the name or formula of which is \nmentioned in a prior-art document, is not thereby considered as known, unless the \ninformation in the document, together, where appropriate, with knowledge generally \navailable on the relevant date of the document, enables it to be prepared and separated or, \nfor instance in the case of a product of nature, only to be separated. \n6.31.5 Generic disclosure and specific examples \nIn considering novelty, it should be borne in mind that a generic disclosure does not usually \ntake away the novelty of any specific example falling within the terms of that disclosure, but \nthat a specific disclosure does take away the novelty of a generic claim embracing that \ndisclosure, e.g. a disclosure of copper takes away the novelty of metal as a generic concept, \nbut not the novelty of any metal other than copper, and one of rivets takes away the novelty \nof fastening means as a generic concept, but not the novelty of any fastening other than \nrivets. \n\n\n \n46 \n6.31.7 Implicit disclosure and parameters \nIn the case of a prior document, the lack of novelty may be apparent from what is explicitly \nstated in the document itself. Alternatively, it may be implicit in the sense that, in carrying \nout the teaching of the prior document, the skilled person would inevitably arrive at a result \nfalling within the terms of the claim. An objection of lack of novelty of this kind should be \nraised by the examiner only where there can be no reasonable doubt as to the practical \neffect of the prior teaching (for a second nonmedical use.  \n \nSituations of this kind may also occur when the claims define the invention, or a feature \nthereof, by parameters. It may happen that in the relevant prior art a different parameter, or \nno parameter at all, is mentioned. If the known and the claimed products are identical in all \nother respects (which is to be expected if, for example, the starting products and the \nmanufacturing processes are identical), then in the first place an objection of lack of novelty \narises. If the applicant is able to show, e.g. by appropriate comparison tests, that differences \ndo exist with respect to the parameters, it is questionable whether the application discloses \nall the features essential to manufacture products having the parameters specified in the \nclaims. \n6.31.8 Examination of novelty \nIn determining novelty of the subject-matter of claims, the examiner should remember that, \nparticularly for claims directed to a physical entity, non-distinctive characteristics of a \nparticular intended use should be disregarded. For example, a claim to a substance X for use \nas a catalyst would not be considered to be novel over the same substance known as a dye, \nunless the use referred to implies a particular form of the substance (e.g. the presence of \ncertain additives) which distinguishes it from the known form of the substance. That is to \nsay, characteristics not explicitly stated, but implied by the particular use, should be taken \ninto account.  \n \nIt should further be borne in mind that a claim to the use of a known compound for a \nparticular purpose (second non-medical use) which is based on a technical effect should be \ninterpreted as including that technical effect as a functional technical feature, and is \naccordingly not open to objection, provided that such technical feature has not previously \nbeen made available to the public.  \n6.31.9 Selection inventions \nSelection inventions deal with the selection of individual elements, subsets, or sub-ranges, \nwhich have not been explicitly mentioned, within a larger known set or range. \ni) In determining the novelty of a selection, it has to be decided, whether the selected \nelements are disclosed in an individualized (concrete) form in the prior art. A selection \nfrom a single list of specifically disclosed elements does not confer novelty. However, if a \nselection from two or more lists of a certain length has to be made in order to arrive at a \nspecific combination of features then the resulting combination of features, not \nspecifically disclosed in the prior art, confers novelty (the “two lists principle”). Examples \nof such selections from two or more lists are the selection of: \n(a) individual chemical compounds from a known generic formula whereby \nthe compound selected results from the selection of specific substituents \nfrom two or more “lists” of substituents given in the known generic \nformula. The same applies to specific mixtures resulting from the selection \nof individual components from lists of components making up the prior art \nmixture; \n(b) starting materials for the manufacture of a final product; \n(c) sub-ranges of several parameters from corresponding known ranges. \n \n\n\n \n47 \n(ii) \nA sub-range selected from a broader numerical range of the prior art is considered \nnovel, if each of the following three criteria is satisfied: \na) the selected sub-range is narrow compared to the known range; \nb) the selected sub-range is sufficiently far removed from any specific examples \ndisclosed in the prior art and from the endpoints of the known range; \nc) the selected range is not an arbitrary specimen of the prior art, i.e. not a \nmere embodiment of the prior art, but another invention (purposive selection, \nnew technical teaching). \nAn effect occurring only in the claimed sub-range cannot in itself confer novelty on that \nsub-range. However, such a technical effect occurring in the selected sub-range, but \nnot in the whole of the known range, can confirm that criterion c) is met, i.e. that the \ninvention is novel and not merely a specimen of the prior art. The meaning of “narrow” \nand “sufficiently far removed” has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. The new \ntechnical effect occurring within the selected range may also be the same effect as that \nattained with the broader known range, but to a greater extent. \n(iii) In the case of overlapping ranges (e.g. numerical ranges, chemical formulae) of \nclaimed subject-matter and the prior art the same principles apply for the assessment \nof novelty as in other cases, e.g. selection inventions.  \n \nIt has to be decided which subject-matter has been made available to the public by a prior \nart disclosure and thus forms part of the state of the art. In this context, it is not only \nexamples, but the whole content of the prior art document which has to be taken into \nconsideration. As to overlapping ranges or numerical ranges of physical parameters, novelty \nis destroyed by an explicitly mentioned end-point of the known range, explicitly mentioned \nintermediate values or a specific example of the prior art in the overlap. It is not sufficient to \nexclude specific novelty destroying values known from the prior art range, it must also be \nconsidered whether the skilled person, in the light of the technical facts and taking into \naccount the general knowledge in the field to be expected from him, would seriously \ncontemplate applying the technical teaching of the prior art document in the range of \noverlap. If it can be fairly assumed that he would do so, it must be concluded that no \nnovelty exists.  \n \nThe criteria mentioned in (ii) above can be applied analogously for assessing the novelty of \noverlapping numerical ranges. As far as overlapping chemical formulae are concerned, \nnovelty is acknowledged if the claimed subject-matter is distinguished from the prior art in \nthe range of overlap by a new technical element (new technical teaching), of the reasons, \nnot published for example a specifically selected chemical residue which is covered in \ngeneral terms by the prior art in the overlapping area, but which is not individualised in the \nprior art document. If this is not the case, then it must be considered whether the skilled \nperson would seriously contemplate working in the range of overlap and/or would accept \nthat the area of overlap is directly and unambiguously disclosed in an implicit manner in the \nprior art, not published. If the answer is yes, then novelty is lacking. \n6.32 Non-Prejudicial Disclosures \n6.32.1 General Remark \nThere are two specific instances (and these are the only two) in  which a prior disclosure of \nthe invention is not taken into consideration as part of the state of the art, viz. where the \ndisclosure was due to, or in consequence of: \n \n(i) \nan evident abuse in relation to the applicant or his legal predecessor – e.g. the \ninvention was derived from the applicant and disclosed against his wish (Section \n23(4)(a)); or \n\n\n \n48 \n(ii) \nthe display of the invention by the applicant or his legal predecessor at an \nofficially recognized international exhibition as defined in Section 23(4)(b) of .  \n6.32.2 Time limit \nAn essential condition, in both instances (i) and (ii), is that the disclosure in point must have \ntaken place not earlier than twelve months preceding the filing of the application. For \ncalculating the twelve-month period the relevant date is that of the actual filing date of the \npatent application (Section 23(4)). \n6.32.3 Evident abuse \nRegarding instance (i), the disclosure might be made in a published document or in any \nother way. As a particular instance, the disclosure might be made in a European application \nof earlier priority date. Thus, for example, a person B who has been told of A's invention in \nconfidence, might himself apply for a patent for this invention. If so, the disclosure resulting \nfrom the publication of B's application will not prejudice A's rights provided that A has \nalready made an application, or applies within twelve months of such publication. B may not \nbe entitled to proceed with his application. For \"evident abuse\" to be established, there must \nbe, on the part of the person disclosing the invention, either actual intent to cause harm or \nactual or constructive knowledge that harm would or could ensue from this disclosure. \n6.32.4 International exhibition \nIn instance (ii), the application must be filed within twelve months of the disclosure of the \ninvention at the exhibition if the display is not to prejudice the application. Furthermore, the \napplicant must state, at the time of filing the application, that the invention has been so \ndisplayed, and must also file a supporting certificate.  \n6.33 Inventive Step (Section 24) \n6.33.1 General \nAn invention is considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the state of the \nart, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art. Novelty and inventive step are different \ncriteria. Novelty exists if there is any difference between the invention and the known art. \nThe question – \"is there inventive step?\" – only arises if there is novelty.  \n6.33.2 State of the art; date of filing \nThe \"state of the art\" for the purposes of considering inventive step does not include later \npublished patent applications. Date of filing - means date of priority where appropriate. \n6.33.3 Person skilled in the art \nThe \"person skilled in the art\" should be presumed to be an ordinary practitioner aware of \nwhat was common general knowledge in the art at the relevant date. He should also be \npresumed to have had access to everything in the \"state of the art\", in particular the \ndocuments cited in the search report, and to have had at his disposal the normal means and \ncapacity for routine work and experimentation. If the problem prompts the person skilled in \nthe art to seek its solution in another technical field, the specialist in that field is the person \nqualified to solve the problem. The assessment of whether the solution involves an inventive \nstep must therefore be based on that specialist's knowledge and ability. There may be \ninstances where it is more appropriate to think in terms of a group of persons, e.g. a \nresearch or production team, than a single person. This may apply, for example, in certain \nadvanced technologies such as computers or telephone systems and in highly specialized \nprocesses such as the commercial production of integrated circuits or of complex chemical \nsubstances. (definition should be considered further) \n\n\n \n49 \n6.33.4 Obviousness \nThus the question to consider, in relation to any claim defining the invention, is whether \nbefore the filing or priority date valid for that claim, having regard to the art known at the \ntime, it would have been obvious to the person skilled in the art to arrive at something \nfalling within the terms of the claim. If so, the claim is not allowable for lack of inventive \nstep. The term \"obvious\" means that which does not go beyond the normal progress of \ntechnology but merely follows plainly or logically from the prior art, i.e. something which \ndoes not involve the exercise of any skill or ability beyond that to be expected of the person \nskilled in the art. In considering inventive step, as distinct from novelty, it is fair to construe \nany published document in the light of subsequent knowledge and to have regard to all the \nknowledge generally available to the person skilled in the art the day before the filing or \npriority date valid for the claimed invention. \n6.33.5 Combination vs. juxtaposition or aggregation \nThe invention claimed must normally be considered as a whole. When a claim consists of a \n\"combination of features\", it is not correct to argue that the separate features of the \ncombination taken by themselves are known or obvious and that \"therefore\" the whole \nsubject-matter claimed is obvious. However, where the claim is merely an \"aggregation or \njuxtaposition of features\" and not a true combination, it is enough to show that the \nindividual features are obvious to prove that the aggregation of features does not involve an \ninventive step.  \nA set of technical features is regarded as a combination of features if the functional \ninteraction between the features achieves a combined technical effect which is different, e.g. \ngreater than the sum of the technical effects of the individual features. In other words, the \ninteractions of the individual features must produce a synergistic effect. If no such \nsynergistic effect exists, there is no more than a mere aggregation of features. For example, \nthe technical effect of an individual transistor is essentially that of an electronic switch. \nHowever, transistors interconnected to form a microprocessor synergically interact to achieve \ntechnical effects, such as data processing, which are over and above the sum of their \nrespective individual technical effects. \n6.33.6 Origin of an invention \nWhile the claim should in each case be directed to technical features (and not, for example, \nmerely to an idea), in order to assess whether an inventive step is present it is important for \nthe examiner to bear in mind that there are various ways in which the skilled person may \narrive at an invention. An invention may, for example, be based on the following: \n(i) The formulation of a new idea or of a yet unrecognised problem to be solved \n(the solution being obvious once the problem is clearly stated); \nExample: Appropriate tests by the applicant revealed that the effect of a known chemical \nformulation was no longer satisfactory after prolonged storage, the claimed solution being \nretrospectively trivial and in itself obvious.  \n(ii)  \nThe devising of a solution to a known problem;  \nExample: the problem of permanently marking farm animals such as cows without causing \npain to the animals or damage to the hide has existed since farming began. The solution \n(\"freeze-branding\") consists in applying the discovery that the hide can be permanently \ndepigmented by freezing. \n(iii)  \nThe arrival at an insight into the cause of an observed phenomenon (the \npractical use of this phenomenon then being obvious);  \nExample: the agreeable flavour of butter is found to be caused by minute quantities of a \nparticular compound. As soon as this insight has been arrived at, the technical application \ncomprising adding this compound to margarine is immediately obvious. Many inventions are \n\n\n \n50 \nof course based on a combination of the above possibilities - e.g. the arrival at an insight \nand the technical application of that insight may both involve the use of the inventive faculty. \n6.33.7 Problem-and –Solution Approach \nIn practice, in order to assess inventive step in an objective and predictable manner, the \nexaminer should normally apply the so-called \"problem-and-solution approach\". In the \nproblem-and-solution approach, there are three main stages: \n(i) \ndetermining the \"closest prior art\", \n(ii) \nestablishing the \"objective technical problem\" to be solved, and \n(iii) \nconsidering whether or not the claimed invention, starting from the closest prior \nart and the objective technical problem, would have been obvious to the skilled \nperson. \n6.33.8 Determination of the closest prior art \nThe closest prior art is that combination of features, disclosed in one single reference, which \nconstitutes the most promising starting point for an obvious development leading to the \ninvention. In selecting the closest prior art, the first consideration is that it should be \ndirected to a similar purpose or effect as the invention or at least belong to the same or a \nclosely related technical field as the claimed invention. In practice, the closest prior art is \ngenerally that which corresponds to a similar use and requires the minimum of structural and \nfunctional modifications to arrive at the claimed invention. \nThe closest prior art must be assessed from the skilled person's point of view on the day \nbefore the filing or priority date valid for the claimed invention. In identifying the closest \nprior art, account should be taken of what the applicant himself acknowledges in his \ndescription and claims to be known. Any such acknowledgement of known art should be \nregarded by the examiner as being correct, unless the applicant states he has made a \nmistake. \n6.33.9 Formulation of the objective technical problem \nIn the second stage, one establishes in an objective way the technical problem to be solved. \nTo do this one studies the application (or the patent), the closest prior art and the difference \n(also called \"the distinguishing feature(s)\" of the invention) in terms of features (either \nstructural or functional) between the invention and the closest prior art and then formulates \nthe technical problem. Features which cannot be seen to make any contribution, either \nindependently or in combination with other features, to the solution of a technical problem \nare not relevant for assessing inventive step. Such a situation can occur for instance if a \nfeature only contributes to the solution of a non-technical problem, for instance a problem in \na field excluded from patentability. In the context of the problem-and-solution approach, the \ntechnical problem means the aim and task of modifying or adapting the closest prior art to \nprovide the technical effects that the invention provides over the closest prior art. The \ntechnical problem thus defined is often referred to as the \"objective technical problem\". \n \nThe objective technical problem derived in this way may not be what the applicant presented \nas \"the problem\" in his application. The latter may require reformulation, since the objective \ntechnical problem is based on objectively established facts, in particular appearing in the \nprior art revealed in the course of the proceedings, which may be different from the prior art \nof which the applicant was actually aware at the time the application was filed. In particular, \nthe prior art cited in the search report may put the invention in an entirely different \nperspective from that apparent from reading the application only. The extent to which such \nreformulation of the technical problem is possible has to be assessed on the merits of each \nparticular case. As a matter of principle any effect provided by the invention may be used as \na basis for the reformulation of the technical problem, as long as said effect is derivable from \nthe application as filed. It is also possible to rely on new effects submitted subsequently \n\n\n \n51 \nduring the proceedings by the applicant, provided that the skilled person would recognise \nthese effects as implied by or related to the technical problem initially suggested. \n \nIt is noted that the objective technical problem must be so formulated as not to contain \npointers to the solution, since including part of a solution offered by an invention in the \nstatement of the problem must, when the state of the art is assessed in terms of that \nproblem, necessarily result in an ex post facto view being taken of inventive activity. The \nexpression \"technical problem\" should be interpreted broadly; it does not necessarily imply \nthat the solution is a technical improvement over the prior art. Thus the problem could be \nsimply to seek an alternative to a known device or process providing the same or similar \neffects or which is more cost-effective. Sometimes, the objective technical problem must be \nregarded as an aggregation of a plurality of \"partial problems\". This is the case where there \nis no technical effect achieved by all the distinguishing features taken in combination, but \nrather a plurality of partial problems is independently solved by different sets of \ndistinguishing features. \n6.33.10 \nCould-would approach \nIn the third stage the question to be answered is whether there is any teaching in the prior \nart as a whole that would (not simply could, but would) have prompted the skilled person, \nfaced with the objective technical problem, to modify or adapt the closest prior art while \ntaking account of that teaching, thereby arriving at something falling within the terms of the \nclaims, and thus achieving what the invention achieves. In other words, the point is not \nwhether the skilled person could have arrived at the invention by adapting or modifying the \nclosest prior art, but whether he would have done so because the prior art incited him to do \nso in the hope of solving the objective technical problem or in expectation of some \nimprovement or advantage. This must have been the case for the skilled person before the \nfiling or priority date valid for the claim under examination.  \n6.33.11 \nCombining prior-art documents \nIt is permissible to combine the disclosure of one or more documents, parts of documents or \nother pieces of prior art (e.g. a public prior use) with the closest prior art. However, the fact \nthat more than one disclosure must be combined with the closest prior art in order to arrive \nat a combination of features may be the sign of the presence of an inventive step. A \ndifferent situation occurs where the invention is a solution to a plurality of independent \n\"partial problems\". Indeed, in such a case it is necessary to separately assess, for each \npartial problem, whether the combination of features solving the partial problem is obviously \nderivable from the prior art. Hence, a different document can be combined with the closest \nprior art for each partial problem. For the subject-matter of the claim to be inventive, it \nsuffices however that one of these combinations of features involves an inventive step. In \ndetermining whether it would be obvious to combine two or more distinct disclosures, the \nexaminer should also have regard in particular to the following: \n(i) \nwhether the content of the disclosures (e.g. documents) is such as to make it \nlikely or unlikely that the person skilled in the art, when faced with the problem \nsolved by the invention, would combine them - for example, if two disclosures \nconsidered as a whole could not in practice be readily combined because of \ninherent incompatibility in disclosed features essential to the invention, the \ncombining of these disclosures should not normally be regarded as obvious; \n(ii) \nwhether the disclosures, e.g. documents, come from similar, neighbouring or \nremote technical fields; \n(iii) \nthe combining of two or more parts of the same document would be obvious if \nthere is a reasonable basis for the skilled person to associate these parts with one \nanother. It would normally be obvious to combine with a prior-art document a \nwell-known textbook or standard dictionary; this is only a special case of the \ngeneral proposition that it is obvious to combine the teaching of one or more \n\n\n \n52 \ndocuments with the common general knowledge in the art. It would, generally \nspeaking, also be obvious to combine two documents one of which contains a \nclear and unmistakable reference to the other. In determining whether it is \npermissible to combine a document with an item of prior art made public in some \nother way, e.g. by use, similar considerations apply. \n6.33.12 \nIndicators \nPredictable disadvantage; non-functional modification; arbitrary choice It should be noted \nthat if the invention is the result of a foreseeable disadvantageous modification of the closest \nprior art, which the skilled person could clearly predict and correctly assess, and if this \npredictable disadvantage is not accompanied by an unexpected technical advantage, then \nthe claimed invention does not involve an inventive step. In other words, a mere foreseeable \nworsening of the prior art does not involve an inventive step. However, if this worsening is \naccompanied by an unexpected technical advantage, an inventive step might be present. \nSimilar considerations apply to the case where an invention is merely the result of an \narbitrary non-functional modification of a prior-art device or of a mere arbitrary choice from \na host of possible solutions. \n \nIt should be remembered that an invention which at first sight appears obvious might in fact \ninvolve an inventive step. Once a new idea has been formulated it can often be shown \ntheoretically how it might be arrived at, starting from something known, by a series of \napparently easy steps. The examiner should be wary of ex post facto analysis of this kind. \nHe should always bear in mind that the documents produced in the search have, of \nnecessity, been obtained with foreknowledge of what matter constitutes the alleged \ninvention. In all cases he should attempt to visualise the overall state of the art confronting \nthe skilled person before the applicant's contribution and he should seek to make a \"real-life\" \nassessment of this and other relevant factors. He should take into account all that is known \nconcerning the background of the invention and give fair weight to relevant arguments or \nevidence submitted by the applicant. If, for example, an invention is shown to be of \nconsiderable technical value, and particularly if it provides a technical advantage which is \nnew and surprising and which is not merely achieved as a bonus effect in a \"one-way street\" \nsituation, and this technical advantage can convincingly be related to one or more of the \nfeatures included in the claim defining the invention, the examiner should be hesitant in \npursuing an objection that such a claim lacks inventive step. \n6.33.13 \nUnexpected technical effect; bonus effect \nAn unexpected technical effect may be regarded as an indication of inventive step. However, \nif, having regard to the state of the art, it would already have been obvious for a skilled \nperson to arrive at something falling within the terms of a claim, for example due to a lack of \nalternatives thereby creating a \"one-way street\" situation, the unexpected effect is merely a \nbonus effect which does not confer inventiveness on the claimed subject-matter. \n6.33.14 \nLong-felt need; commercial success \nWhere the invention solves a technical problem which workers in the art have been \nattempting to solve for a long time, or otherwise fulfils a long-felt need, this may be \nregarded as an indication of inventive step. Commercial success alone is not to be regarded \nas indicative of inventive step, but evidence of immediate commercial success when coupled \nwith evidence of a long-felt want is of relevance provided the examiner is satisfied that the \nsuccess derives from the technical features of the invention and not from other influences \n(e.g. selling techniques or advertising). \n\n\n \n53 \n6.33.15 \nArguments and evidence submitted by the applicant \nThe relevant arguments and evidence to be considered by the examiner for assessing \ninventive step may either be taken from the originally-filed patent application or submitted \nby the applicant during the subsequent proceedings. Care must be taken, however, \nwhenever new effects in support of inventive step are referred to. Such new effects can only \nbe taken into account if they are implied by or at least related to the technical problem \ninitially suggested in the originally filed application. Example of such a new effect: The \ninvention as filed relates to a pharmaceutical composition having a specific activity. At first \nsight, having regard to the relevant prior art, it would appear that there is a lack of inventive \nstep. Subsequently, the applicant submits new evidence which shows that the claimed \ncomposition exhibits an unexpected advantage in terms of low toxicity. In this case, it is \nallowable to reformulate the technical problem by including the aspect of toxicity, since \npharmaceutical activity and toxicity are related in the sense that the skilled person would \nalways contemplate the two aspects together. The reformulation of the technical problem \nmay or may not give rise to amendment or insertion of the statement of the technical \nproblem in the description. Any such amendment is only allowable if it satisfies the set out \nconditions. In the above example of a pharmaceutical composition, neither the reformulated \nproblem nor the information on toxicity could be introduced into the description without \ninfringing. \n6.33.16 \nSelection inventions \nThe subject-matter of selection inventions differs from the closest prior art in that it \nrepresents selected sub-sets or sub-ranges. If this selection is connected to a particular \ntechnical effect, and if no hints exist leading the skilled person to the selection, then an \ninventive step is accepted (this technical effect occurring within the selected range may also \nbe the same effect as attained with the broader known range, but to an unexpected degree). \nThe criterion of \"seriously contemplating\" mentioned in connection with the test for novelty \nof overlapping ranges should not be confused with the assessment of inventive step. For \ninventive step, it has to be considered whether the skilled person would have made the \nselection or would have chosen the overlapping range in the hope of solving the underlying \ntechnical problem or in expectation of some improvement or advantage. If the answer is \nnegative, then the claimed matter involves an inventive step. \n \n6.33.17 \nDependent claims; claims in different categories \nIf an independent claim is new and non-obvious, there is no need to investigate the novelty \nand the non-obviousness of any claims dependent thereon, except in situations where the \nsubject-matter of a dependent claim has a later effective date than the independent claim \nand intermediate documents are to be considered. Similarly, if a claim to a product is new \nand non-obvious there is no need to investigate the novelty and non-obviousness of any \nclaims for a process which inevitably results in the manufacture of that product or of any \nclaims for a use of that product. In particular, analogy processes, i.e. processes which \nthemselves would otherwise not involve an inventive step, are nevertheless patentable \ninsofar as they provide a novel and inventive product. It should, however, be noted that in \ncases where the product, process and use claims have different effective dates, a separate \nexamination as to novelty and inventive step may still be necessary in view of intermediate  \ndocuments. \n \nExamples of circumstances where an invention may be regarded as obvious or where it may \ninvolve an inventive step: \nThese examples are for illustrative purposes and that the applicable principle in each case is \n\"was it obvious to a person skilled in the art?\". Examiners should avoid attempts to fit a \n\n\n \n54 \nparticular case into one of these examples if it is not clearly applicable. Also, the list is not \nexhaustive. \n \n \nExamples Relating to the Requirement of Inventive Step-\nIndicators \n1. Application of known measures? \n \n1.1 Inventions involving the application of known measures in an obvious way \nand in respect of which an inventive step is therefore to be ruled out: \n(i) the teaching of a prior document is incomplete and at least one of the possible ways of \n\"filling the gap\" which would naturally or readily occur to the skilled person results in the \ninvention; \nExample: The invention relates to a building structure made from aluminium. A prior \ndocument discloses the same structure and says that it is of light-weight material but fails to \nmention the use of aluminium. \n(ii) the invention differs from the known art merely in the use of well-known equivalents \n(mechanical, electrical or chemical);  \nExample: The invention relates to a pump which differs from a known pump solely in that \nits motive power is provided by a hydraulic motor instead of an electric motor. \n(iii) the invention consists merely in a new use of a well-known material employing the \nknown properties of that material; (is it this simple?) \nExample: Washing composition containing as detergent a known compound having the \nknown property of lowering the surface tension of water, this property being known to be an \nessential one for detergents. \n(iv) the invention consists in the substitution in a known device of a recently developed \nmaterial whose properties make it plainly suitable for that use (\"analogous substitution\");  \nExample: An electric cable comprises a polyethylene sheath bonded to a metallic shield by \nan adhesive. The invention lies in the use of a particular newly developed adhesive known to \nbe suitable for polymer-metal bonding. \n(v) the invention consists merely in the use of a known technique in a closely analogous \nsituation (\"analogous use\"). \nExample: The invention resides in the application of a pulse control technique to the electric \nmotor driving the auxiliary mechanisms of an industrial truck, such as a fork-lift truck, the \nuse of this technique to control the electric propulsion motor of the truck being already \nknown. \n \n1.2 Inventions involving the application of known measures in a non-obvious way \nand in respect of which an inventive step is therefore to be recognised: \n(i) a known working method or means when used for a different purpose involves a new, \nsurprising effect; \nExample: It is known that high-frequency power can be used in inductive butt welding. It \nshould therefore be obvious that high-frequency power could also be used in conductive butt \nwelding with similar effect. However, if high-frequency power were used for the continuous \nconductive butt welding of coiled strip but without removing scale (such scale removal \nnormally being necessary during conductive welding in order to avoid arcing between the \nwelding contact and the strip), there is the unexpected additional effect that scale removal is \nfound to be unnecessary because at high frequency the current is supplied in a \n\n\n \n55 \npredominantly capacitive manner via the scale which forms a dielectric. In that case, an \ninventive step would exist. \n(ii) a new use of a known device or material involves overcoming technical difficulties not \nresolvable by routine techniques. \nExample: The invention relates to a device for supporting and controlling the rise and fall of \ngas holders, enabling the previously employed external guiding framework to be dispensed \nwith. A similar device was known for supporting floating docks or pontoons but practical \ndifficulties not encountered in the known applications needed to be overcome in applying the \ndevice to a gas holder. \n \n2. Obvious combination of features? \n2.1 Obvious and consequently non-inventive combination of features: \nThe invention consists merely in the juxtaposition or association of known devices or \nprocesses functioning in their normal way and not producing any non-obvious working inter-\nrelationship. \nExample: Machine for producing sausages consists of a known mincing machine and a \nknown filling machine disposed side by side. \n2.2 Not obvious and consequently inventive combination of features: \nThe combined features mutually support each other in their effects to such an extent that a \nnew technical result is achieved. It is irrelevant whether each individual feature is fully or \npartly known by itself. However, if the combination of features is a bonus effect, e.g. as the \nresult of a \"one-way street\" situation, the combination might lack an inventive step. \nExample: A mixture of medicines consists of a painkiller (analgesic) and a tranquillizer \n(sedative). It was found that through the addition of the tranquillizer, which intrinsically \nappeared to have no painkilling effect, the analgesic effect of the painkiller was intensified in \na way which could not have been predicted from the known properties of the active \nsubstances. \n3. Obvious selection? \n3.1 Obvious and consequently non-inventive selection among a number of known \npossibilities: \n(i) the invention consists merely in choosing from a number of equally likely alternatives; \nExample: The invention relates to a known chemical process in which it is known to supply \nheat electrically to the reaction mixture. There are a number of well-known alternative ways \nof so supplying the heat, and the invention resides merely in the choice of one alternative. \n \n(ii) the invention resides in the choice of particular dimensions, temperature ranges or other \nparameters from a limited range of possibilities, and it is clear that these parameters could \nbe arrived at by routine trial and error or by the application of normal design procedures; \nExample: The invention relates to a process for carrying out a known reaction and is \ncharacterized by a specified rate of flow of an inert gas. The prescribed rates are merely \nthose which would necessarily be arrived at by the skilled practitioner. \n \n(iii) the invention can be arrived at merely by a simple extrapolation in a straightforward way \nfrom the known art; \nExample: The invention is characterised by the use of a specified minimum content of a \nsubstance X in a preparation Y in order to improve its thermal stability, and this \ncharacterizing feature can be derived merely by extrapolation on a straightline graph, \nobtainable from the known art, relating thermal stability to the content of substance X. \n\n\n \n56 \n(iv) the invention consists merely in selecting particular chemical compounds or compositions \n(including alloys) from a broad field: \nExample: The prior art includes disclosure of a chemical compound characterized by a \nspecified structure including a substituent group designated \"R\". This substituent \"R\" is \ndefined so as to embrace entire ranges of broadly-defined radical groups such as all alkyl or \naryl radicals either unsubstituted or substituted by halogen and/or hydroxy, although for \npractical reasons only a very small number of specific examples are given. The invention \nconsists in the selection of a particular radical or particular group of radicals from amongst \nthose referred to as the substituent \"R\" (the selected radical or group of radicals not being \nspecifically disclosed in the prior-art document since the question would then be one of lack \nof novelty rather than obviousness). The resulting compounds: \n(a) are neither described as having nor shown to possess any advantageous properties not \npossessed by the prior art examples; or \n(b) are described as possessing advantageous properties compared with the compounds \nspecifically referred to in the prior art, but these properties are ones which the person skilled \nin the art would expect such compounds to possess, so that he is likely to be led to make \nthis selection. \n3.2 Not obvious and consequently inventive selection among a number of known \npossibilities: \n(i) the invention involves special selection in a process of particular operating conditions (e.g. \ntemperature and pressure) within a known range, such selection producing unexpected \neffects in the operation of the process or the properties of the resulting product; \nExample: In a process where substance A and substance B are transformed at high \ntemperature into substance C, it was known that there is in general a constantly increased \nyield of substance C as the temperature increases in the range between 50 and 130 °C. It is \nnow found that in the temperature range from 63 to 65 °C, which previously had not been \nexplored, the yield of substance C was considerably higher than expected. \n \n(ii) the invention consists in selecting particular chemical compounds or compositions \n(including alloys) from a broad field, such compounds or compositions having unexpected \nadvantages. \nExample: In the example of a substituted chemical compound given at (iv) under 3.1 above, \nthe invention again resides in the selection of the substituent radical \"R\" from the total field \nof possibilities defined in the prior disclosure. In this case, however, not only does the \nselection embrace a particular area of the possible field, and result in compounds that can be \nshown to possess advantageous properties (see IV, 9.11 and VI, 5.3.5) but there are no \nindications which would lead the person skilled in the art to this particular selection rather \nthan any other in order to achieve the advantageous properties. \n4. Overcoming a technical prejudice? \nAs a general rule, there is an inventive step if the prior art leads the person skilled in the art \naway from the procedure proposed by the invention. This applies in particular when the \nskilled person would not even consider carrying out experiments to determine whether these \nwere alternatives to the known way of overcoming a real or imagined technical obstacle. \n6.34  \nIndustrial application \nUnder section 25 of the Act, an invention shall be considered industrially applicable if it can \nbe made or used in any kind of industry, including agriculture, medicine, fisheries and other \nservices. \n \n\n\n \n57 \n\"Industry\" should be understood in its broad sense as including any physical activity of \n\"technical character\", that is an activity which belongs to the useful or practical arts as \ndistinct from the aesthetic arts; it does not necessarily imply the use of a machine or the \nmanufacture of an article and could cover e.g. a process for dispersing fog or for converting \nenergy from one form to another.  \n \nSection 25 excludes from patentability very few \"inventions\" which are not already excluded \nby the list in section 21(3). One further class of \"invention\" which would be excluded, \nhowever, would be articles or processes alleged to operate in a manner clearly contrary to \nwell-established physical laws, e.g. a perpetual motion machine.  \n \nObjection could arise under section 25 only insofar as the claim specifies the intended \nfunction or purpose of the invention, but if, say, a perpetual motion machine is claimed \nmerely as an article having a particular specified construction then objection should be made \nunder Art.83. \n6.34.1 Surgery, therapy and diagnostic methods \nMethods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic \nmethods practised on the human or animal body shall not be regarded as inventions which \nare industrially applicable. This provision shall not apply to products, in particular substances \nor compositions, for use in any of these methods. Hence, patents may be obtained for \nsurgical, therapeutic or diagnostic instruments or apparatuses for use in such methods. The \nmanufacture of prostheses or artificial limbs could be patentable. For instance, a method of \nmanufacturing insoles in order to correct the posture or a method of manufacturing an \nartificial limb should be patentable. In both cases, taking the imprint of the footplate or a \nmoulding of the stump on which an artificial limb is fitted is clearly not of a surgical nature \nand does not require the presence of a medically qualified person. Furthermore, the insoles \nas well as the artificial limb are manufactured outside the body. However, a method of \nmanufacturing an endoprosthesis outside the body, but requiring a surgical step to be \ncarried out for taking measurements, would be excluded from patentability. \n \nPatents may also be obtained for new products for use in methods of treatment or diagnosis, \nparticularly substances or compositions. However, in the case of a known substance or \ncomposition, this may only be patented for use in methods if the known substance or \ncomposition was not previously disclosed for use in surgery, therapy or diagnostic methods \npractised on the human or animal body (\"first medical use\").  \n \nThe same substance or composition cannot subsequently be patented for any other use of \nthat kind. A claim to a known substance or composition for the first use in surgical, \ntherapeutic and/or diagnostic methods should be in a form such as: \"Substance or \ncomposition X\" followed by the indication of the use, for instance \"... for use as a \nmedicament\", \"... as an antibacterial agent \" or \"... for curing disease Y\".  \n \nThese types of claims will be regarded as restricted to the substance or composition when \npresented or packaged for the use. However, this does not mean that product claims for first \nmedical use need not fulfil all other requirements of patentability, especially that of inventive \nstep. \n \nA claim in the form \"Use of substance or composition X for the treatment of disease Y ...\" \nwill be regarded as relating to a method for treatment explicitly excluded from patentability \nby Section 21(3)(c) and therefore will not be accepted. \nIf an application discloses for the first time a number of distinct surgical, therapeutic or \ndiagnostic uses for a known substance or composition, normally in the one application \n\n\n \n58 \nindependent claims each directed to the substance or composition for one of the various \nuses may be allowed; that is an a priori objection of lack of unity of invention should not, as \na general rule, be raised. \n \nA claim in the form \"Use of a substance or composition X for the manufacture of a \nmedicament for therapeutic application Z\" is allowable for either a first or \"subsequent\" \n(second or further) such application (\"second medical use\"-type of claim or \"Swiss-type\" \nclaim), if this application is new and inventive. The same applies to claims in the form \n\"Method for manufacturing a medicament intended for therapeutic application Z, \ncharacterised in that the substance X is used\" or the substantive equivalents thereof. In \ncases where an applicant simultaneously discloses more than one \"subsequent\" therapeutic \nuse, claims of the above type directed to these different uses are allowable in the one \napplication, but only if they form a single general inventive concept. Regarding use or \nmethod claims of the above type, it should also be noted that a mere pharmaceutical effect \ndoes not necessarily imply a therapeutical application.  \n \nFor instance, the selective occupation of a specific receptor by a given substance cannot be \nconsidered in itself as a therapeutic application; indeed, the discovery that a substance \nselectively binds a receptor, even if representing an important piece of scientific knowledge, \nstill needs to find an application in the form of a defined, real treatment of a pathological \ncondition in order to make a technical contribution to the art and to be considered as an \ninvention eligible for patent protection. \nLimitations of exclusion under Section 21(3)(c) \nIt should be noted that Section 21(3)(c) excludes only methods of treatment by surgery or \ntherapy and diagnostic methods. It follows that other methods of treatment of live human \nbeings or animals (e.g. treatment of a sheep in order to promote growth, to improve the \nquality of mutton or to increase the yield of wool) or other methods of measuring or \nrecording characteristics of the human or animal body are patentable provided that (as \nwould probably be the case) such methods are of a technical and not essentially biological \ncharacter and are industrially applicable. The latter proviso is particularly important in the \ncase of human beings. For example, an application with a claim for a method of \ncontraception, which is to be applied in the private and personal sphere of a human being, is \nnot industrially applicable. However, an application containing claims directed to the purely \ncosmetic treatment of a human by administration of a chemical product is considered \nindustrially applicable. A cosmetic treatment involving surgery or therapy would, however, \nnot be patentable. \n \nIn order to be excluded, a treatment or diagnostic method must actually be carried out on \nthe living human or animal body. A treatment of or diagnostic method practised on a dead \nhuman or animal body would therefore not be excluded from patentability by virtue of \nSection 21(3)(c). \nTreatment of body tissues or fluids after they have been removed from the human or animal \nbody, or diagnostic methods applied thereon, are not excluded from patentability insofar as \nthese tissues or fluids are not returned to the same body. Thus the treatment of blood for \nstorage in a blood bank or diagnostic testing of blood samples is not excluded, whereas a \ntreatment of blood by dialysis with the blood being returned to the same body would be \nexcluded. \n \nRegarding methods which are carried out on or in relation to the living human or animal \nbody, it should be borne in mind that the intention of Section 21(3)(c) is only to free from \nrestraint non-commercial and non-industrial medical and veterinary activities. Interpretation \nof the provision should avoid the exclusions from going beyond their proper limits. \n\n\n \n59 \n \nHowever, in contrast to the subject-matter referred to in Art. 52(2) and (3) which is only \nexcluded from patentability if claimed as such, a method claim is not allowable under Section \n21(3)(c) if it includes at least one feature defining a physical activity or action that \nconstitutes a method step for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy \nor a diagnostic method step to be exercised on the human or animal body. In that case, \nwhether or not the claim includes or consists of features directed to a technical operation \nperformed on a technical object is legally irrelevant to the application of Section 21(3)(c). \n \nTaking the three exclusions in turn: \nSurgery defines the nature of the treatment rather than its purpose. Thus, for example, a \nmethod of treatment by surgery for cosmetic purposes or for embryo transfer is excluded, as \nwell as surgical treatment for therapeutic purposes. \n \nTherapy implies the curing of a disease or malfunction of the body and covers prophylactic \ntreatment, e.g. immunisation against a certain disease or the removal of plaque. A method \nfor therapeutic purposes concerning the functioning of an apparatus associated with a living \nhuman or animal body is not excluded if no functional relationship exists between the steps \nrelated to the apparatus and the therapeutic effect of the apparatus on the \nbody. \n \nDiagnostic methods likewise do not cover all methods related to diagnosis. Methods for \nobtaining information (data, physical quantities) from the living human or animal body are \nnot excluded by Section 21(3)(c), if the information obtained merely provides intermediate \nresults which, on their own, do not enable a decision to be made on the treatment \nnecessary.  \n \nGenerally such methods include X-ray investigations, NMR studies, and blood pressure \nmeasurements. \n6.34.2 Method of testing \nMethods of testing generally should be regarded as inventions industrially applicable and \ntherefore patentable if the test is applicable to the improvement or control of a product, \napparatus or process which is itself industrially applicable. In particular, the utilisation of test \nanimals for test purposes in industry, e.g. for testing industrial products (for example for \nascertaining the absence of pyrogenetic or allergic effects) or phenomena (for example for \ndetermining water or air pollution) would be patentable.  \n6.34.3 Industrial application vs. exclusion under Sec. 21(3) \nIt should be noted that \" industrial application\" is not a requirement that overrides the \nrestriction of Sec. 21(3), e.g. an administrative method of stock control is not patentable, \nhaving regard to Sec. 21(3)(c), even though it could be applied to the factory store-room for \nspare parts. On the other hand, although an invention must be \"industrially applicable\" and \nthe description must indicate, where this is not apparent, the way in which the invention is \nthus industrially applicable,  the claims need not necessarily be restricted to the industrial \napplication(s). \n6.35  \nMatters excluded from patentability \nSection 21(3) sets out a list of exclusions from patentability, namely: \n \n2l(3)(a) - \na discovery, scientific theory or mathematical method; \nNote. The fact that a known material has an unknown property is a discovery and as such is \nnot itself patentable, but an application or use of that material may be patentable eg in a \n\n\n \n60 \nparticular process. Similarly, finding a new substance or micro-organism occurring in nature \nis a discovery, but the process of isolating and extracting it, and the material so obtained, \ncould be patentable. \n \n21(3)(b) - \na scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act, playing a game or \ndoing business; \nWhat is the position in regard to patents on computer programs? \n \nNote: \n(i)  \nalthough rules for games cannot be patented (again they are covered by copyright), \napparatus for playing a particular game (eg comprising board, pieces and rules) may \nbe patentable  \n \n(ii)  \n\"methods of doing business\" is an exclusion of importance. Methods of book keeping, \ntrading stocks and shares etc are generally not patentable \n \n \n21(3)(c) -  \ndiagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans and \nanimals. \n \nNote: Another exclusion of major importance.  Pharmaceutical products are patentable, as \nare methods of making them. Equipment for use in medicine and surgery (eg scalpels, \noperating tables) is also patentable. \n \n21(3)(d) -  \nthe presentation of information  \nNote: This exclusion relates to simple non-technical devices such as credit card voucher or a \nbus ticket. A camera with a new way of presenting information in the viewfinder to assist the \nphotographer would however be patentable. \n \n21(3)(e) -  \npublic health related methods of use or uses of any molecule or other \nsubstance whatsoever used for the prevention or treatment of any disease which the \nminister responsible for matters relating to health may designate as a serious health hazard \nor as a life threatening disease. \nNote: This provision was included in the Industrial Property Act, 2001 following the \ndeclaration of AIDS as a national disaster by the President of the Republic of Kenya. \n \n26(a) - Plant varieties as provided for in the Seeds and Plant Varieties Act Cap 326 but not \nparts thereof or products of biotechnological processes, and \n \n26(b) - Inventions contrary to public order, morality, public health and safety, principles of \nhumanity and environmental conservation. \n \nProbably the most important exclusions, as indicated above, are business methods and \nmethods of medically treating humans and animals. It is particularly important to note that \nsuch methods may be patentable in some other countries, including the United States, so \nIPERs drawn up by USPTO and US equivalent patents should be checked carefully to ensure \nthat they do not cover claims to business methods or to diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical \nmethods for the treatment of humans or animals. \n \nEqually it important to note that sections 21(3) and 26 does not exclude computer \nprogrammes.  \n\n\n \n61 \n6.36  \nMatters prejudicial to public order, morality, safety and environment \nSection 26(b) excludes from patentability inventions of which the commercial exploitation \nwould be contrary to public order or morality, or prejudicial to humans, animals or plant life \nor health, or to the environment. What is excluded here will probably be decided by \ngovernment policy, for instance, land mines, mantraps and letter bombs might be excluded \nhere, or methods for cloning human beings. It is important for patent examiners to be aware \nof this section, although the occasions when this section is invoked are in practice likely to \nbe rare.  \n \n6.37  \nRecommendation to grant \nIf the examiner considers that the application satisfies the requirements of the Act and is \nthus in order to proceed to grant, he should make a brief written report on his findings. \nThese should be a summary of the search and examination report. \n6.38  \nRecommendation to refuse \nWhen making a report for an application which is not in order for grant of a patent, the \nexaminer should set out the points at issue, the case history to the extent necessary to \nenable a quick grasp of the essential facts, and recommend the action to be taken, e.g. \nrefusal, or grant conditional upon certain further amendments.  \n \nIf, on the other hand, the examiner is satisfied that the applicant has had sufficient \nopportunity to amend and that all the requirements are still not met, she should issue a \ndecision to refuse the application. The grounds of refusal must be stated and full reasons \nmust be given. \nRefusal may be based only on grounds on which the applicant has had an opportunity to put \nforward comments. In addition, the applicant's attention must be directed to the provisions \nfor appeal laid down in section 47. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n62 \nChapter VII: \nGrant and publication \n7.0 \nGrant of Patent \nIf the applicant has fulfilled the requirements of the Act, a patent is granted, provided that \nmaintenance, grant and publication fees have been paid. Every patent granted shall be \nregistered, and published in the Journal. A certificate of grant of a patent in Form IP 10 \nshould be issued and accompanied with a copy of the patent documents (abstract, disclosure \nand claims) as at the time of grant. \n \n7.1 \nRegisters of patent applications and grants \nThe register is kept as a permanent record of the summary particulars of the patent \napplications and grant. The summary particulars mainly comprise of bibiliographic. The \nrecord items to be entered in the register with respect to patent applications are laid down in \nRegulation 30(2) and should include: \na) The application number  \nb) The filing date; \nc) The name and address of the applicant; \nd) The title of the invention; \ne) The name and address of the inventor (except where inventor is not to be named as \nprovided under Section 33 of the Act); \nf) If priority is claimed, the priority date and the name of the state in which or for which \nthe earlier application was filed; \ng) The date of the request for an examination submitted under section 44(2) of the Act; \nh) The publication date of the application; \ni) The address for service of the applicant; \nj) A notice of every document effecting a change in ownership of the application or \npurporting to give the application or an interest in it as security; \nk) If the applicant dies, a notice of that fact; and \nl) Any other information required under the Act or these Regulations or that the \nManaging Director considers appropriate. \n \nFor granted patents the information above should be included and in addition:- \na) The number of the patent; \nb) The name and address of the owner of the patent; \nc) The date of the grant of the patent; \nd) The address for service of the owner; \ne) A notice of every document effecting a change in \nf) ownership of the patent or purporting to give the patent or an interest in it as \nsecurity: \ng) A notice of every document effecting a change in \nh) ownership of a licence or purporting to give a licence or an interest in it as security; \ni) If the owner of the patent dies, a notice of that \nj) fact; and \nk) Any other information required under the Act or the Regulations or that the Managing \nDirector considers appropriate. \n \nA person who wishes to obtain an extract from the patent register should make a request in \nForm IP 11 for a certified copy or in Form IP 12 for an uncertified copy. \n\n\n \n63 \n \nChapter VIII: \nRegional and International Applications \n8.0 \nIntroduction \nThe Institute acts as a receiving Office for regional applications under the Harare Protocol \nand for international applications filed under the Patent cooperation Treaty. Where the \nInstitute acts as a receiving Office the following documents must be filed in triplicate: -  \n• \nthe request,  \n• \nthe description,  \n• \nthe claims,  \n• \nthe abstract; and \n• \nthe drawings where applicable.  \n \nAn application for which the Institute is chosen by the applicant as the receiving Office must \nbe filed directly with the Institute.  \n \nThe initial processing and formal examination of international applications are carried out by \nthe receiving Office and the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization (WIPO) in accordance with the provisions of the PCT. When the Institute is \nacting as a receiving Office, the formality checks will be done in accordance with the PCT \nReceiving Office Guidelines. \n  \nWith regard to deadlines and procedural steps before the Institute as a receiving Office, \nexaminers should use the guidelines for receiving office issued by the WIPO. \n \n8.1 \nNational Phase \nWhere an applicant is desirous of obtaining a patent in respect of Kenya through the PCT \nroute, he must seek entry into the national phase by the 30th month from the international \nfiling date. Where priority is claimed entry into the national phase should be sought by the \n30th month from the priority date. \n \nTo enter the national phase the applicant should file the request on Form IP 13 and \naccompany with a copy of the patent application as published by the WIPO. During entry \ninto the national phase it is the duty of the applicant to do the following:-  \n \n• \nif the applicant is non resident, must be represented by a registered patent Agent \nwho should submit form IP 39 upon payment of the prescribed fee. \n• \nProvide a translation of the specification if the international application was not \npublished in English. \n• \nPay the application fee. \n• \nRequest for national processing of the application preferably by submitting a duly \ncompleted Form IP 13.  \n \nIf any amendments have been filed and they are not in English, then under Regulation 79 \nthe applicant should be invited to file the required translation within two months. Any \namendment which remains not translated should be ignored. \n \n8.2 \nSubstantive Examination of PCT Applications \nOrdinarily, PCT applications will be accompanied by the opinion of the international search \nexaminer and/or the IPEA’s examiner as to the presence of novelty, inventive step and \n\n\n \n64 \nindustrial applicability. Depending on the opinion of the IPER, applications will fall into one of \nthe following three categories, which will determine course of substantive examination:  \n \n(i)  \nPCT applications with a wholly favourable IPER \nIf the IPER is wholly favourable then the major requirements of section 44(3) can be taken \nas met. However the exclusions listed in sections 21(3) and 26 should be checked since \nmethods for treating people and animals, methods for doing business etc. cannot be \npatented in Kenya but may be patentable elsewhere. If there is an objection under sections \n21(3) and 26, a proposal to reject the application should be made stating the grounds of \nsuch refusal. \n \nWhere no objection under sections 21(3) and 26 a substantive examination report generated \nas well as an examiner’s internal recommendation to grant forwarded to the Managing \nDirector. \n \nUpon approval by the Managing Director, the grant and publication procedure outlined \nearlier with regard to national applications should apply apply. \n \n(ii)  \nPCT applications with an IPER which is favourable in respect of novelty, \ninventive step and industrial application but where other defects or observations \nare noted \n \n \n(iii)  \nPCT applications with an IPER which is unfavourable in respect of one or \nmore of novelty, inventive step and industrial application or with another major \nobjection outstanding; \nFor this case there are basically two possibilities: \n(a) \n the defects or observations are not at variance with the requirements of the Act or \nthe Regulations therefore no valid objections can be raised. For instance, PCT rule \n6.4(a) has provision different from the Act. In such cases, after checking the \nrequirements of sections 21(3) and 26, the procedure set out in the case where the \nexaminer internally recommends the application for grant above applies. \n \n(b)  \nthe defects or observations are such that it is clear what constitutes a valid response. \n \nALL OTHER APPLICATIONS, ie \n(III)  PCT application with an IPER which is unfavourable in respect of one or more of \nnovelty, inventive step and industrial application, or with another major objection \noutstanding. \n(VI)  \nPCT applications without an IPER;  \n \nThe applicant may be requested to provide, in respect of any application for a patent (or \nother title of protection) for the same invention: \n \n(1)  \nthe date and number of that application  \n(2)  \na copy of: \n(a)  \nany search or examination report,  \n(b)  \nthe patent (or other title),  \n(c) \n any final decision refusing the application, and  \n(d) \n any final decision invalidating the patent or other title. \n(3)  \na verified translation of any of the above if not in English \n \n\n\n \n65 \nSuch documents may be used only for facilitating the evaluation of the novelty and Inventive \nstep, ie such documents do not themselves provide the applicant with any rights in Kenya \nand the applicant too may be invited to comment on any of the documents he has furnished. \n \nIf a suitable equivalent patent i.e. one granted by an appropriate Industrial Property Office \n(or an equivalent application) has been noted by the applicant or found in the Patent \nRegistry, e.g. by an online search, then a response should be issued suggesting amendment \nin accordance with the foreign patent. If the application has not yet been granted, the letter \nshould be amended accordingly. The requirements of sections 21(3) and 26 should also be \nchecked. \n \nIf a suitable equivalent has not been found, then the applicant should be invited to submit \ndetails of equivalent patents (or patent applications).  \n \nIf Kenya is an elected Office then applicants cannot be required to furnish information or \ndocuments in respect of the same international application being examined in any other \nelected Office. The requirements of sections 21(3) and 26 should also be checked. Once a \nsuitable granted patent in English - or a verified translation thereof filed under Regulation 79 \n- has been received, then the procedure set out for substantive examination of national \napplications is applied. \n \n8.3 \nARIPO Patents Utility Models designs designating Kenya \n \nThe examiner shall carefully scrutinize all patents and utility models applications designating \nKenya with a view of ensuring that the provisions of the Act are fully complied with and that \nthe requisite communications under the said sections are sent to the ARIPO Secretariat \nwithin six months from the date of the notification by ARIPO. \n \n \nChapter IX: \nAnnual fees \nUnder section 61 in order to keep alive a patent application or a granted patent, an annual \nfee is annually due in advance by or before the anniversary of the filing date, starting one \nyear after the filing date. However, the fee is payable within a grace period of six months \nprovided that the applicant pays the prescribed surcharge. \n \nIf the application has not come through the PCT route, then the filing date will be that \ndetermined under section 41. If the application has come through the PCT route, then the \nfiling date will be the international filing date. \n \nFailure to pay annual or maintenance fee will result in the application or patent being \ndeemed to be withdrawn or lapsed. Under section 38(7)(d)(ii) the lapse of a patent is \nrequired to be entered in the register and published in Industrial Property Journal or in the \nGazette. \n \nIn the case of PCT applications, annual fees need not be paid until the application enters the \nnational phase. \n\n\n \n66 \n \nPART II: INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS \n1.0 \nIntroduction \nThese Guidelines are structured to follow the sequence of the examination process with each \nsection and sub-section constituting a step in the registration proceedings from the receipt of \nthe application up to registration and publication. The General Principles (see below) should \nbe kept in mind throughout the whole examination process.  \n2.0 \nGeneral Principles  \n2.1 \nRegistration  \nThe Industrial Property Act requires the creation and maintenance of a Register of designs in \nwhich the particulars of the registrations will be entered (Sec 45, Reg. 45).  \n2.3 \nScope of Examination  \nThe registration procedure involves examination of compliance with the requirements of the \nAct and the Regulations. However, there are three substantive grounds for refusing an \napplication:  \nwhere the subject-matter of the application does not correspond to the definition of a design \nas set forth in Sec. 84 ; or  \n• \nwhere the design is contrary to public policy or accepted principles of morality. (Sec. \n86 (4)) \n• \nwhere the design is not new as required by Sec. 86 of the Act. \n(what about design copyright overlap?) \n \nWhere one of these three grounds is applicable, the examiner notifies the applicant \naccordingly in the examination report. The applicant will be given the opportunity of \nwithdrawing or amending (Reg. 50) the application or of submitting his/her observations \nbefore the examiner takes a decision. The meanings of “design” and “public policy or \naccepted principles of morality” are explained in section 5 below.  \n2.5 \nTime Limits (Reg. 76)  \nThe general rules for the calculation of time limits given in the Act, the Reg. (47(11) and \n24(2,3)) and the 2nd Schedule are specified in these Guidelines. If a request for extension of \na time limit is made before its expiry and reasons are given by the applicant, then a further \nperiod will be allowed. Additional extensions will be granted in exceptional cases only.  \n2.6 \nDecisions (Reg. 50)  \nIn all cases where an examiner takes a decision adverse to the applicant the grounds for the \ndecision must be given. Such decision is communicated via a standard letter, containing \nlanguage that will be adapted to each particular case, which refers to the relevant provisions \nof the Regulations and explains the reason(s) for the decision.  \n2.7 \nAppeal (Sec. 112, Reg. 74, 75)  \nApplicants have a right to appeal against any decision of the Managing Director to the \nIndustrial Property Tribunal.  \n\n\n \n67 \n \n2.8 \nReceipt of Application  \nDate of Receipt and File Number (Sec.87 )  \nThe application shall be presented by the applicant or agent to the Institute. The application \nwill then be assigned a file number and receiving date then captured in IPAS upon payment \nof the filing fees; after which the application will be transmitted to the patent registry for \nfurther processing. In each case the pages of the document making up the application are \nmarked with the date of receipt and the file number of the application.  \n2.9 \nAllocation of Filing Date  \nMinimum Requirements (Sec. 87(6))  \nIn order to allocate a filing date to an application for a registered design the examiner \nchecks whether the application contains at least:- \na) a request for registration of a design (IP. Form 27), and information identifying \nthe applicant, and  \nb) a graphic representation of the article embodying the industrial design or a \nspecimen.  (sec 87(2) –specific on specimen requirement) \nc) Application fees \nd) Identification of the Applicant (Sec. 87(7))  \n \nThe requirement under paragraph 4.1.(b) for according a filing date does not mean that the \ninformation identifying the applicant has to comprise all the details set out in paragraph \n11.1. It has to be clear from that information who the applicant is, i.e. natural persons have \nto indicate at least their family name and given names(s); legal entities need to state their \nusual designation.  \n2.10 Representation of the Design (Sec. 87(7))  \nSince the representation is the means to specify the features of the design for which \nprotection is sought, it is of utmost importance that it is clear and complete and that nothing \nregarding the design is left to conjecture.  \n \nDrawings, photographs (except slides), computer-made representations or any other \ngraphical representation are accepted provided they are suitable for reproduction.  \n \nFor the purpose of allocating a filing date, a representation is considered suitable for \nreproduction when it meets the requirement that the design must be reproduced on a \nneutral background and must not be retouched with ink or correcting fluid. It must be of a \nquality permitting all the details of the matter for which protection is sought to be clearly \ndistinguished and permitting it to be reduced or enlarged to a size not more than 8 cm by 16 \ncm per view for entry in the Register and for direct publishing in the Industrial Property \nJournal referred to in Sec. 91. A background is considered neutral as long as the design is \nclearly discernible on it. It is acceptable to present graphic representations in colour-e.g. \nphotographs mounted on paper. \n \nThe Institute accepts all representations of designs that meet the formal requirements of \nReg.15. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the representation of the \ndesign is of a quality allowing all the details for which protection is sought to be clearly \ndistinguished.  \n\n\n \n68 \n3.0 \nFiling date  \nThe first task for the examiner is to determine whether the application meets the \nrequirement for according the filing date. These requirements are prescribed under section \n87(6) as listed in paragraph above.  \n \nThe documents referred to above should be in English but do not have to meet any \nparticular requirements as to form or presentation. It is essential however they be \nsufficiently legible to enable the information to be discerned. The applicant should be \nconsidered sufficiently identified whenever it is possible to establish the identity of the \napplicant beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of all data contained in the documents filed. \nWhere there is more than one applicant each applicant must be similarly identified. No \nobjection should be raised at this stage with regard to the status of the applicant or his \nentitlement to apply.  \n \nIf the application does not fulfil these requirements the examiner is required to invite the \napplicant, within 14 days from the date of the examination, to submit the required \ncorrection. The invitation should indicate that the applicant has 60 days to comply. If the \napplicant does not comply with the invitation and, as a result, the examiner treats the \napplication as if it had not been filed, the examiner should, within fourteen days, inform the \napplicant in writing. \n \nWhere an application meets the aforementioned requirements, the receiving date becomes \nthe filing date and the same must be so communicated to the applicant in writing. \n4.0 \nFormal Requirements \n4.1 \nDetails of the applicant (Sec. 87) \nThe applicant must state his/her name, address, nationality and the State in which he/she is \ndomiciled or has his/her seat or establishment. Names of natural persons must be indicated \nby the person's family name and given name(s). In addition to their names, companies, \nfirms and other legal entities must indicate their form of incorporation, which may be \nabbreviated (e.g. Ltd., Inc., PLC, S.A.), and indicate the law of the State governing them.  \n \nThe names of legal entities should be given in full and only their form of incorporation may \nbe abbreviated. The address should contain, if possible, the street, street number, city or \ncounty, postal code and country. The applicant should indicate only one address, but if there \nare several, the first one mentioned will be recorded by the examiner as the address for \nservice, unless the applicant specifically designates another one as an address for service. \nThe telephone numbers as well as fax numbers and details of other data communication \nlinks, such as electronic mail, may be given by the applicant. \n4.2 \nCitation of Creator(s) (Sec. 85,33 )  \nThe application shall include a citation of the creator(s) or an indication that the creator(s) \nhas/have waived the right to be cited. The citation and the waiver or the absences of any \nindication regarding the creator(s) are not subject to examination. Where neither a creator is \ncited nor a waiver of the right to be cited is indicated, an objection will be raised by the \nexaminer. \n \nIn cases where the applicant is not the designer, a statement justifying the applicant’s right \nto the design-an assignment-shall also be filed.  \n\n\n \n69 \n4.4 \nFormat of the Representation of the Design (Reg. 47)  \nThe graphic representation of the design must consist of a graphic or photographic \nreproduction of a single design in black and white or in colour. It must fulfil the following \nrequirements:  \na) the representation must be filed on separate sheets of paper or reproduced on the page \nprovided in the form made available by the Institute;  \nb) in case of separate sheets of paper, the design must be reproduced on white and opaque \npaper either pasted or printed directly on it. Only one copy must be filed and the sheets \nof paper must not be folded or stapled;  \nc) the size of the separate sheet must be A4 size (29.7 cm high, 21 cm wide) and the space \nused for the reproduction must not be larger than 26.2 cm x 17 cm. A margin of at least \n2.5 cm must be left on the left-hand side; the sheets of paper must also indicate on the \ntop the number of views and, in case of a multiple application, the consecutive number \nof the design; they must not contain any explanatory text, wording or symbols other \nthan the indication or the name or address of the applicant;  \nd) the design must be reproduced on a neutral background and must not be retouched with \nink or correcting fluid. It must be of a quality permitting all the details of the matter for \nwhich protection is sought to be clearly distinguished and permitting it to be reduced or \nenlarged to a size not more than 8 cm by 16 cm per view for entry in the Register and \nfor direct publishing in the Journal. The Institute will accept colour representations. \nWhere the representation is in colour, the registration and the publication will also be in \ncolour.  \n \nIt is the applicant’s interest and responsibility to submit a suitable representation including a \nsufficient number of views to specify all the features of the design for which protection is \nsought.  The examiner will not check whether the design might have other features which \nare not shown in the views as submitted.  \n \nThe representation should include a sufficient number of different views of the design to \nenable the examiner conceptualize the features of the design for which protection is sought. \nWhere the examiner is of the opinion that the number of views presented is not sufficient, \nhe may ask for more. The views may be plain, elevation, section, or perspective views. Detail \nviews of portions of the design on an enlarged scale may be used as well. The alternate \npositions of a design, or of a feature of the design, must be shown in separate views. Each \nof the representations must be labelled by the applicant in to indicate the views they \nrepresent. Where more than one view is presented, and the applicant has not indicated \nwhich view should accompany the publication, the examiner should select one representative \nview for publication.  \n \nThe examiner should check whether the views relate to the same design. The representation \nof a design should be limited to the features for which protection is sought. \n \nHowever, the representations may comprise other elements that help to identify the features \nof a design for which protection is sought. In an application for registration of a design the \nfollowing identifiers will be allowed:-  \n \na. \nDotted lines may be used in a view either to indicate the elements for which no \nprotection is sought or to indicate portions of the design which are not visible in that \nparticular view, i.e. non-visible lines. Therefore, dotted lines identify elements which \nare not part of the view in which they are used.  \nb. \nBoundaries may be used to surround features of the design for which protection is \nsought.  \nc. \nColouring may be used on a black and white drawing to highlight the features of the \ndesign for which protection is sought only. Where the design concerns ornamentation, \n\n\n \n70 \na product to which it is applied may be identified by dotted lines or the ornamentation \nmay be surrounded by boundaries.  \n \nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to use the dotted lines, boundaries and colouring in such a \nway to make clear for which features protection is sought and for which not, since the \nexaminer will not conduct any examination other than verifying the suitability of the \nreproduction for publication.  \n4.5 \nRepetitive Patterns  \nWhere the registration of a design consisting in a repeating surface pattern is applied for, \nthe representation of the design must show the complete pattern and a sufficient portion of \nthe repeating surface.  \n4.6 \nTypographic Typefaces  \nWhere registration for a design consisting of a typographic typeface is applied for, the \nrepresentation of the design must consist of a representation of a string of all the letters of \nthe alphabet, upper case and lower case, and of all the Arabic numerals, as well as of a text \nof five lines produced with the typographic typefaces, all being in the size pitch 16.  \n4.7 \nSignature  \nThe application has to be signed by the applicant or his/her representative  \n4.8 \nTreating Deficiencies (Sec. 41(2, 3))  \nIf there is any deficiency regarding one of the above requirements, the examiner \nnotifies the applicant accordingly in the examination report. \n5.0 \nIndication of Products  \n5.1 \nClear Indication \nThe application must further contain an indication of the products in which the design is \nintended to be incorporated or to which it is intended to be applied. The applicant has to \nword the products in such a way as to indicate clearly the nature of the products and to \nallow each of them to be classified in only one class of the Locarno Classification. It should \nbe noted that the indication of products does not affect as such the scope of protection of a \ndesign.  \n \nThe examiner may invite the applicant to amend the wording used by the applicant in order \nto indicate a product with an equivalent term belonging to the Locarno Classification. \nStraightforward examples are synonyms American/English such as jewelry – jewellery, trunk \n– boot, sidewalk - pavement, nightshifts – nightshirts, garbage – rubbish etc. However, the \nexaminer should refrain from replacing the applicant’s wording with a more specific term.  \n5.2 \nPreferred Form  \nIn order to speed up and simplify the registration procedure, it is highly recommended that \napplicants indicate the products by using the terms listed in the Locarno Classification which \nis accessible on-line at www.wipo.int.  \n5.3 \nTreating Deficiencies  \nIn case the application does not contain an indication of products the examiner notifies the \napplicant of the deficiency in the examination report. \n\n\n \n71 \n6.0 \nTransmission of the application to ARIPO (Reg. 31) \nWhere the applicant chooses to file his/her application at the Institute the date of receipt of \nthe application by the Institute will become the date of filing, provided that the application \nmeets all the formal requirements under the Harare Protocol. The Institute will prepare and \ntransmit the application immediately the applicant pays the transmittal fee together with the \nactual cost of mailing. \n7.0 \nTreating Deficiencies  \nWhere a priority is claimed, the examiner should check whether:  \na) the file number of the earlier application is indicated;  \nb) the filing date of the application for a registered design falls within the period of six \nmonths of the claimed priority date;  \nc) the previous application(s) has/have been filed in or for a State on the Paris Convention \nlist or the WTO list;  \nd) the time limit to file a declaration of priority is complied with.  \n \nThe examiner will examine whether the subject-matter of the priority application and the \npresent application are the same. He will raise an objection only where a clear discrepancy is \nfound.  \n \nWhere a deficiency has been found, the examiner will invite the applicant to remedy the \ndeficiencies in the examination report. If the deficiencies cannot be remedied, the right of \npriority will be lost.  \n \nWhere the examiner finds that the applicant has lost a right to claim a priority, he/she \nnotifies the applicant accordingly.  \n8.0 \nExamination:  Grounds for Non- Registrability. \nThe examiner will refuse the application where he/she finds that the subject-matter of the \napplication does not correspond to the definition of a design as set forth in Sec. 84 ; or is not \nnovel as required by Sec. 86 , or  is contrary to public policy or to accepted principles or \nmorality.  \n8.1 \nDefinition of “design” (Sec. 84a).  \nAn “industrial design” means any composition of lines or colours or any three dimensional \nform, whether or not associated with lines or colours; Provided that such composition or \nform gives a special appearance to a product of industry or handicraft and can serve as a \npattern for a product of industry or handicraft. \n  \n \nA “product” means any industrial or handicraft item, including packaging, get-up, graphic \nsymbols or typographic typefaces, but excluding computer programs.  \n \nCompliance with the definition of a design is subject to examination. Failure to comply with \nthe definition constitutes a ground for non-registrability.  \n \nWhere the application concerns the design of a product composed of multiple components, \nthe representation of the design must include at least one view showing the product as a \nwhole, i.e. all components assembled, otherwise the representation is considered as \ncomprising multiple designs. A representation comprising multiple designs constitutes a \ndeficiency in the format of the representation (see paragraph 11.4).  \n \nWhere a representation comprises a set of articles, the representation will not be considered \nas representing a design in the meaning of Sec. 84 except where it is clear from the \n\n\n \n72 \nrepresentation that protection is sought for a design resulting from the combination of the \nfeatures of the articles. Such a combination may arise e.g. where the articles of the set are \nso closely related that they can be considered as forming a single product. For example, \nwhere forks, spoons and knives show common features, they will be considered as set of \narticles. At least one view has to show the set of articles together.  \n \nWhether the product indicated is actually made or used, or can be made or used, in an \nindustrial or handicraft manner, shall not be examined.  \n8.2 \nPublic Policy and Morality (Sec. 86(4))  \nThe examiner rejects an application if the design is contrary to public order or accepted \nprinciples of morality. There is no legal definition of “public order” and “morality” in the Act. \nAny refusal on that ground has to be reasoned by reference to the perception of the public \nwithin Kenya. By way of example, designs that contain racist messages or images are not \nacceptable. Poor taste manifested in a design is not a ground for non-registrability.  \n8.3 \nTreating Deficiencies (Sec. 87(7); Reg. 50)  \nWhere a ground for non-registrability is found, the examiner will notify the applicant in the \nexamination report along with other deficiencies, if any. A time limit of sixty days will be set \nfor the applicant to submit his/her observations, request for a hearing, withdraw the \napplication or amend it by submitting an amended representation of the design, provided \nthat the identity of the design is retained. The application will be rejected if the applicant \nfails to overcome the ground for non-registrability. \n9.0 \nClassification  \n9.1 \nPurpose (Sec. 87 (4))  \nThe examiner has to bear in mind that the classification of products serves exclusively \nadministrative purposes. It does not affect as such the scope of protection of a design.  \n9.2 \nLocarno Classification  \nThe most recent version of the Classification under the Locarno Agreement applies. The \nLocarno Agreement contains a List of Classes and an Alphabetical List giving a general \nindication of fields to which the products belong. The Alphabetical List should be consulted \nfor the classification of each specific product.  \n9.3 \nClassification by the Applicant \nThe applicant may submit with the application a classification of products indicating the \nclass(es) and sub-class(es) according to the Locarno Classification.  \n \nIf the applicant provides a classification, the products must be grouped according to the \nclasses of the Locarno Classification, each group being preceded by the number of the \nrelevant class and presented in the order of the classes and sub-classes.  \n \nThe applicant’s failure to submit a classification or failure to group or sort the products as \nrequired does not constitute a deficiency. The examiner is bound to confirm the applicant’s \nclassification or re-classify the application according to the current Locarno Classification. \n9.4 \nClassification by the Examiner  \nWhere the applicant has not submitted a classification, it will be produced by the examiner.  \n \nWhere the applicant has submitted a classification, but the classification being incorrect, the \nexaminer will substitute the classification of the applicant by his classification.  \n\n\n \n73 \n \nIf a product cannot be classified in accordance with the List of Classes or the Alphabetical \nList, the examiner may either request the applicant to specify the nature and purpose of the \ndesignated product, or classify the product in class 99 of the Locarno Classification (i.e. \n“Miscellaneous”) on condition that the product will be removed from this class as soon as a \nsuitable class is determined.  \n10.0 Multiple Design Applications \nTwo or more industrial designs may not be the subject of the same application (multiple \ndesign application). The Act has no provision for filing of multiple designs in a single \napplication. Such a filing constitutes a deficiency. \n11.0 Priority  \nPrevious Application(s) (Sec. 37)  \nPriority may be claimed on the basis of a previous (first) application of a design filed in or for \na State which is party to the Paris Convention or a member of the WTO. Priority can only be \nclaimed where the application for a design is filed within six months from the date of filing of \nthe first application(s).  \n \nWhere priority claim is declared for an application, the applicant must indicate the file \nnumber of the previous application(s) and file a copy thereof or the registration certificate \nissued by the competent authority shall be demanded by the Institute after three months \nfrom the date of making the declaration. Such a demand must be complied with within 90 \ndays from the date of invitation. \n12.0 Publication and opposition Period (Reg. 48 and 49)  \nFor all applications recommended for registration, the Managing Director shall publish a \nnotice of an application to register an industrial design in the Kenya Gazette or in the \nIndustrial Property Journal. Before the notice is published, the applicant shall pay the \npublication fee. Within 60 days after the notice of the application is published a person may \noppose the application by giving a notice of opposition in Form IP 23 in duplicate to the \nManaging Director.  \n \nThe notice of opposition shall set out the grounds for opposing the application. The \nManaging Director shall give one copy of the notice of opposition to the applicant. Within 42 \ndays after receiving the notice of opposition, the applicant shall give a counter-statement in \nForm IP 28 in duplicate to the Managing Director. The counter-statement shall set out the \ngrounds the applicant relies upon to support the application and shall set out any facts \nalleged in the notice of opposition that the applicant admits. \n \nThe Managing Director shall give one copy of the counter-statement to the person opposing \nthe application. Within 42 days after receiving the counter-statement, the person opposing \nthe application shall give to the Managing Director and to the applicant a statutory \ndeclaration or affidavit supporting the opposition to the application. \n \nWithin 42 days after receiving the statutory declaration or affidavit of the person opposing \nthe application, the applicant shall give to the Managing Director and to the person opposing \nthe application a statutory declaration or affidavit supporting the application. \n \nWithin one month after receiving the statutory declaration or affidavit of the applicant, the \nperson opposing the application may give to the Managing Director and to the applicant a \nstatutory declaration or affidavit replying to the applicant’s statutory declaration or affidavit. \n\n\n \n74 \nA statutory declaration or affidavit replying to the applicant’s statutory declaration or affidavit \nshall be confined to matters strictly in reply. If the applicant fails to provide a counter-\nstatement or a statutory declaration or affidavit, the application shall be deemed to have \nbeen withdrawn. \n \nIf the person opposing the application fails to provide a statutory declaration or affidavit, the \nopposition to the application shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. \n \nAfter all documents have been provided the Managing Director shall conduct a hearing of the \nmatter. The Managing Director shall give at least 14 days notice of the hearing to each \nparty. A party may be heard at the hearing only if the party provides the Managing Director \nwith a notice in Form IP 29 at least seven days before the date of the hearing.
